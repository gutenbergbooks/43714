<p>It is not for one like me to make any pretense
at trying to fashion a scholar's story out of the
poor efforts of Sidney Hubbard, and myself,
Clare Butler, to second the brave work of those
noble men who, by enduring countless hardships
and sparing not their own blood, finally rid
the Carolinas of those leeches who claimed to be
the king's servants&mdash;Governor William Tryon,
Edmund Fanning and others of like brood.</p>

<p>I count to set down on these pages such an
account as I may be able to give concerning
what we of the Carolinas did in those dark days
eight years before the first patriot blood was shed
at Lexington, and this task is to be performed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
simply that my descendants may, by reading our
story, use their utmost efforts to preserve the fair
country which has cost their forefathers so much
of blood, anguish and bodily suffering.</p>

<p>To begin, Sidney Hubbard is my first cousin,
his mother and mine being sisters. We lived,
in 1768, on the Alamance, near where, later, was
fought what may rightly be termed the first
battle in the struggle of the colonies for independence.
Our fathers were humble farmers,
with a scanty store of this world's goods, and
continually ground down by those whom the
king had set in authority over us, chief among
which may be reckoned the Irishman Tryon,
and Fanning, who was born on Long Island, if
I remember rightly.</p>

<p>I cannot set down in my own words a picture
of the Carolinas at the time when Sidney Hubbard
and I were come sixteen years of age,
therefore, in order that all the conditions of
public affairs may be fully understood, I shall
copy here what was written many years later by
one who may justly style himself a historian:<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p>"The passage of the Stamp Act produced
great uneasiness in the public mind in North
Carolina, as well as in the other provinces.
Already the extortions of public officers in the
exactions of fees for legal services had greatly
irritated the people, and they regarded the requirements
of the Stamp Act as a more gigantic
scheme for legal plunder.... William Tryon
had been acting governor and commander-in-chief
of the province from the death of Governor
Dobbs, April 1st, 1765, and now began his
career of misrule in America. He was appointed
governor toward the close of the year. This
was the same Tryon, afterward governor of New
York, haughty, innately cruel, fond of show, obsequious
when wishing favors, and tyrannical when
independent; he was entirely incompetent to
govern a people like the free, outspoken colonists
of the Upper Carolinas.</p>

<p>"For several years previous to the Stamp Act
excitement, rebellion had been ripening among
the people in the western counties. The rapacity
of public officers, and the corrupt character
of ministers of justice, weighed heavily upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
the property and spirits of the people. The
most prominent evils complained of were the
exorbitant charges of the clerks of the Superior
Courts, whereby these courts had become instruments
of oppression; and oppressive taxes
exacted by the sheriffs, and the outrages committed
by those officers when their authority
was questioned in the least. These evils everywhere
existed, and every petition of the people
for redress appeared to be answered by increased
extortions."</p>

<p>It was William Husband, a Quaker from
Pennsylvania, who banded our people together
in what was called "A Regulation," and each
member signed an agreement to pay no more
taxes "until satisfied they were legal; to pay
officers no more fees than the strict letter of the
law required, unless forced to, and then to show
open resentment; to be cautious in the selection
of representatives, and to petition the governor,
council, king and parliament for a redress of
grievances; to keep up a continual correspondence
with each other; to defray all necessary
expenses, all differences in judgment to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
submitted to the whole Regulation, the judgment
of the majority to be final."</p>

<p>Each member was bound by a solemn oath
to stand faithful to the cause until matters had
been brought to a true and just regulation.
Meetings were held regularly in the vicinity of
Hillsborough, and in a few weeks the Regulation
was a permanent and a powerful body.</p>

<p>About this time "the pride and folly of
Governor Tryon led him to demand" from the
Assembly an appropriation of twenty-five
thousand dollars that he might build a palace,
and this burden, together with the many
which had been laid upon us, was most oppressive.</p>

<p>"The inhabitants of North Carolina were now
thoroughly awakened to the conviction that
both the local and imperial government were
practically hostile to the best interests of the
colonists. The taxes hitherto were very burdensome;
now the cost of the palace, and the appropriation
to defray the expenses of running
the dividing line between their province and
the hunting-grounds of the Cherokees, made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
them insupportable. A poll tax of one dollar
and fifty cents was levied on every male, white
or black, between the ages of sixteen and sixty
years of age.</p>

<p>"The rapacity of public officers appeared to
increase, and the people saw no prospect of
relief. Among the most obnoxious men who
had grown rich by extortionate fees, was
Edmund Fanning, a lawyer of ability. He was
regarded as a co-worker with the government.
The people detested him, and avoided no
occasion to express their displeasure. His first
open rupture with the Regulators was in the
spring of 1768. Tryon issued a proclamation,
half menacing and half persuasive, evidently
intended to awe the Regulation and persuade
the other inhabitants to avoid that association.
He sent his secretary, David Edwards, to cooperate
with Fanning in giving force to the proclamation
among the people.</p>

<p>"They directed the sheriff to appoint a meeting
of the vestry-men of the parishes and the
leading Regulators, to consult upon the public
good and settle all differences. Fair promises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
dispelled the suspicions of the Regulators, and
their vigilance slumbered while awaiting the
day of meeting. They were not yet fully acquainted
with the falsity of their governor, or
they would never have heeded the fair words
of his proclamation. They were soon assured
of the hollowness of his professions, for, while
they were preparing, in good faith, to meet
government officers in friendly convention, the
sheriff, at the instigation of Fanning, proceeded,
with thirty horsemen, to arrest Herman Husband
and William Hunter on a charge of riotous
conduct.</p>

<p>"These, the most prominent men among the
Regulators, were seized and cast into Hillsborough
jail. The whole country was aroused
by this treachery, and a large body of the people,
led by Ninian Bell Hamilton, a brave old
Scotchman of threescore-and-ten-years, marched
toward Hillsborough to rescue the prisoners."</p>

<p>Some idea may be had of our unhappy
province, by aid of the above account, written
in all fairness, and yet not stating our grievances
as thoroughly as they should be set down, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
now I feel warranted in saying that from the
day of Masters Husband's and Hunter's arrest
Sidney Hubbard and I began to prove ourselves
<i>men</i> of the Carolinas.</p>

<p>We were both just turned sixteen, Sidney
being but two days older than I, and already
had the sheriff warned us that we must pay the
taxes which had been assessed, or be sent to
jail where many a poor wretch was confined,
simply because he had not the money with which
to satisfy the governor's unjust demands.</p>

<p>It was on the day after the arrest of our
neighbors that we two lads met old Jacob Peyster,
a God-fearing man, and one who was
ready and willing to lay down his life for the
good of the Carolinas.</p>

<p>"Why are ye abroad this morning?" he
asked, reining in a mettlesome horse which he
had raised from a colt, and we were forced to
bring our steeds to a halt, or give fair proof
that we lacked good breeding.</p>

<p>"We came out to learn if there was any news
concerning those honest men whom the king's
knaves took into custody yesterday," Sidney
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
made answer before I, who was ever slow of
speech, could do so much as open my mouth.</p>

<p>"Masters Husband and Hunter have been
clapped in prison at Hillsborough," the old man
said sorrowfully, "and unless the true men of
the Carolinas take the matter in hand, they are
like to be held by the brute Tryon till the little
property they own has passed into the hands of
his majesty's gluttons."</p>

<p>"You speak as if there was some hope the
men of the Carolinas would resist this outrage,"
Sidney cried excitedly.</p>

<p>"Aye, lad, and so they will. Hamilton, the
Scotchman, is in arms and enlisting under his
flag those who love the colony better than they
do the king. Have you youngsters paid the
tax which is levied on all who have lived sixteen
years or more?"</p>

<p>"It is not likely that I shall be able to do so,"
I hastened to make answer. "My father cannot
give me the money, and the little I had
hoarded up from the sale of my furs, went toward
paying the last levy made against our
poor home."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>"It looks much as though both Clare and I
might soon join Masters Husband and Hunter at
Hillsborough, for I have heard it said that but
a short time will be allowed us of the Carolinas
in which to gather the money to pay the tax, so
eager is Governor Tryon to build his palace,"
and as he spoke Sidney tried in vain to appear
unconcerned, but I, who knew that which was
in his mind, had good proof that he was in
deadly fear of the arrest concerning which he
spoke so glibly.</p>

<p>"Aye, lads, the time will be made short indeed.
I hear that Lawyer Fanning is issuing warrants
for those who are not down on the governor's
books as having paid the unjust assessment.
You are like to be deprived of liberty soon,
unless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?" Sidney asked eagerly as
Master Peyster hesitated.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is wrong for me to speak further
without knowing of what minds are your
parents."</p>

<p>"That can be easily learned; our fathers have
not the money with which to pay their own tax,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
after giving up all they owned to aid in satisfying
the thirst for gold with which the king's
officers in this colony are afflicted," Sidney said
with a laugh which had in it nothing of mirth.</p>

<p>"Then how will you answer the collectors?"
old Jacob asked, eying us sharply.</p>

<p>"If it so be I can find a hiding-place, there
will be no answer given," I made haste to reply.
"Sidney and I were discussing the matter even
as we met you."</p>

<p>"By joining the force which Ninian Hamilton
is gathering you may be free from the sheriffs for
a time; but it is possible that by so doing you
will be charged with treason."</p>

<p>"Do you count on serving with him, Master
Peyster?" Sidney asked, and the old man replied
quickly,</p>

<p>"I have already set down my name as one
who will serve the colonies to the best of my
poor powers, for I am of the Regulation, as are
your fathers. I am but now summoning all of
the association to the rescue of those who are so
unjustly imprisoned&mdash;those who were taken because
they put faith in Tryon's sworn word."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>"Where may Master Hamilton's force be
found?" I asked eagerly, for now my mind
was made up to join those who would measure
strength against the king.</p>

<p>My plight could not well be worse in case I
should be charged with treason, for of a verity
the inability to raise such an amount of money
as the hungry officeholders demanded was, in
the Carolinas, a greater crime than that of conspiring
against the king himself.</p>

<p>"The rendezvous is near Chapel Hill, where
the highway crosses the New Hope River. You
will not be welcomed, however, unless you go
armed, for the association can provide neither
weapons nor money."</p>

<p>Having said this much old Jacob spurred his
horse on, as if afraid of saying anything which
might influence us in our decision; but he need
not have been so particular, because even before
he ceased speaking both Sidney and I were resolved.</p>

<p>The dear lad turned to me with a question in
his eyes when Master Peyster rode away, and
I answered it by saying:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>"There is naught else left for us to do. From
what the old man said we know that the sheriff's
officers will soon be at our heels, and anything
is better than rotting in Hillsborough
jail."</p>

<p>"Then we have only to turn back for our
weapons, and the treason is complete," he said
with a laugh, wheeling his horse around as he
spoke.</p>

<p>I could see nothing of mirthfulness in the
act we were about to commit, although I was none
the less determined to join Master Hamilton's
forces.</p>

<p>This hurried visit to our homes would be the
last, perhaps, forever, and even under the most
favorable circumstances, hiding as we should be
from the sheriff's officers, neither Sidney nor I
would be able to visit our loved ones, save by
stealth, until many months had passed.</p>

<p>I say again, it was a desperate act for two
lads hardly more than sixteen years of age, and
yet there appeared to be no alternative.</p>

<p>We rode to our homes swiftly, and without
indulging in conversation; each of us had so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
much food for thought that he could not speak
of ordinary matters.</p>

<p>The Hubbard plantation was no more than
two miles from my home, and it came first on
our road.</p>

<p>I remained outside, not dismounting, while
Sidney entered, and when perhaps half an hour
had passed he joined me, turning his head ever
so little lest I should see traces of tears on his
cheeks.</p>

<p>He had with him his rifle, a brace of pistols
which had been his father's, a new hunting
knife, and a package which I fancied was made
up of provisions.</p>

<p>"Did your father make any protest?" I
asked while he was mounting.</p>

<p>"He set off for the rendezvous an hour ago,"
Sidney replied, doing his best to suppress a sob.
"Mother believed it was best for me to join
him rather than go to Hillsborough jail, and
did what she might to hasten my departure."</p>

<p>When he was mounted we rode on to my
home, and he remained outside while I broke
the news to my mother.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>She, dear soul, was not surprised. Old Jacob
had stopped there to summon father, who was
one of the Regulators, and almost before I could
speak she clasped me to her bosom, saying
gently and lovingly:</p>

<p>"Yes, you must go, my boy, and my share of
the heavy burden which the Lord has laid upon
the colony will be to remain here alone, trembling
at every sound lest it betokens the coming
of some one who brings tidings that my son or
my husband has been killed. If perchance such
a blow is dealt me, I shall know that you died
like brave men in the performance of duty&mdash;for
it is your duty to aid the oppressed. Do
not delay, gather up such articles as will be
needed, and then kiss me farewell; I cannot
linger on the parting."</p>

<p>In less than half an hour I joined Sidney,
giving no heed as to whether he could see the
tears in my eyes, and during a full hour we
rode at a gentle pace towards the rendezvous
without speaking.</p>

<p>In that time it seemed to me that I had
passed the age of boyhood and was become a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
man, for of a verity I had set my face towards
a man's work whether I might accomplish it or
no.</p>

<p>Then we both struggled to throw off the grief
which enveloped us until the day was like unto
the night, and spoke of what might be done if
all who had joined the Regulation came forward
in response to duty, little dreaming of that
dreadful day when so many of our friends and
neighbors would lie stark and cold upon the
field of battle.</p>

<p>It was but natural that we should speak of
the possible glory to be won, and not to be wondered
at that each of us believed he could perform
all which might be required. We had yet
to learn how great was the task set the men of
the Carolinas before the yoke of the oppressors
was finally thrown off.</p>

<p>From our homes to New Hope River was but
little more than twelve miles, and when we
judged that half the distance had been traversed
we drew rein to give the horses a breathing spell,
for they had traveled ten miles or more before
we came upon old Jacob.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>We drew from our store of provisions sufficient
for the noonday meal, picketed the horses where
they might feast on the rich grass, and gave ourselves
up to a brief time of repose.</p>

<p>The meal had no more than been eaten, however,
when hoof-beats in the distance told that
a horseman was approaching, and I seized my
rifle, for the sorrows which had been mine during
the day made me apprehensive of danger
from every point.</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish," Sidney said sharply. "It
will be said that we are afraid of our own shadows,
if some friend finds us ready for an attack.
There are others beside ourselves who will ride
to New Hope River this day, and he who comes
is most likely one of Master Hamilton's party."</p>

<p>"If so he is headed in the wrong direction,"
I replied; but I drew back from my weapon
nevertheless, and an instant later regretted having
done so when Sandy Wells, one of the sheriff's
officers, rode up beside us.</p>

<p>"We are well met, young sirs," he said in a
mocking tone as he drew from his pocket two
folded papers. "I was but this moment counting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the miles 'twixt me and your homes, for if I
mistake not you are Clare Butler," he said looking
at me, and, turning toward my comrade,
added, "You are Sidney Hubbard."</p>

<p>It was useless to deny the fact, since Sandy
knew our faces full well, and I asked, steadying
my voice till it sounded reasonably firm:</p>

<p>"What have we two lads to do with so gallant
an officer as you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatsoever, if it so be you have
paid the poll tax which his worshipful excellency
has levied on all males, white or black,
between the ages of sixteen and sixty."</p>

<p>"You must know we have not paid that extortion
to provide the governor with a palace,
for it is hardly more than six weeks since a levy
was made of two shillings to the acre of all
tilled lands, and we, who owned not a single
rod, were forced to help our fathers pay that,"
I said stoutly, noting the fact that Sidney was
drawing his rifle toward him.</p>

<p>"Then must I serve these warrants to the end
that I may legally take you to Hillsborough until
such time as you shall pay the just and lawful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
demands of his worshipful excellency, Governor
Tryon."</p>

<p>"And how may we come by the money while
we are shut up in jail?" I asked, beginning to
have an inkling of what Sidney would do.</p>

<p>"That is not for me to say, my pert gentleman.
If you cannot pay the tax, here is my authority
for taking you to Hillsborough," and the conceited
rascal proceeded to read in a loud voice
the documents he had drawn from his pocket.</p>

<p>I could understand but little of their purport,
so filled were they with attorney's words and
phrases, nor did I cudgel my brains overmuch,
because of what I could see out of the tail of my
eye.</p>

<p>Sidney had his rifle in hand, and the
expression on his face told me that he had no
intention of going to Hillsborough as Sandy
Wells' prisoner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="s08">A TREASONABLE ACT.</span></h2>

<p>So great was my excitement, knowing Sidney
meditated an attack upon the king's officer,
which could be called neither more nor less
than rank treason and would put us beyond
the pale of ordinary offenders, that I could not
understand one word Sandy Wells was reading.</p>

<p>His voice came to me like the droning of
bees in the summer, and it sounded far off. I
could neither hear nor think; but all my faculties
were centered in my eyes as I watched
Sidney's stealthy movements.</p>

<p>Without really having the power of connected
thought, I realized that to resist the sheriff's
officer was an offense which Governor Tryon
would never pardon, particularly since that officer
was engaged in the effort to collect taxes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
From the moment we made forcible resistance
we would be the same as outlawed, and shut
off from the possibility of returning again to
our homes until the king's rule had been set
aside in the Carolinas.</p>

<p>Desperate indeed would be our position once
an overt act against the recognized authority of
the colony had been committed, and yet I would
not have checked Sidney by so much as a hair's
breadth had it been possible.</p>

<p>Sandy Wells continued to read as if delighting
in the sound of his own voice, and my comrade
made his preparations leisurely, being
slightly in the rear of the sheriff's officer where
he could not well be seen, while the latter's eyes
were fixed upon the paper.</p>

<p>When Sidney cautiously drew himself up to
his feet by aid of an overhanging bough, clutching
his rifle firmly, I knew the struggle was
about to begin, and during an instant there was
a film before my eyes, red like blood.</p>

<p>Then everything came plain within my line
of vision; the tremor of fear passed away, and
I was on the alert to second anything Sidney
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
should attempt, even though our lives might be
the forfeit.</p>

<p>Sandy Wells had nearly come to an end of the
warrants which had been filled out that two
lads who could not pay the sum of three dollars
might be thrust into jail, when Sidney, his rifle
leveled at the officer's head, said sharply and
sternly:</p>

<p>"Do not so much as move, Master Wells, else
I will send a bullet into your brain. Be careful
not to take your hands from that piece of stamped
paper, or I shall believe that you mean mischief!"</p>

<p>Sandy looked around quickly; only his eyes
moved, for he must have understood that my
comrade meant every word which had been
spoken, and he saw Sidney standing with his
rifle aimed and resting on the branch of the
tree.</p>

<p>At such short range there could be no mistake
as to the course of the bullet, and, realizing this,
the officer's face grew white with fear, for of
a verity he was standing very near to death at
that moment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you resist me in the performance of
my sworn duty?" he asked, his voice trembling
and his teeth literally chattering with fear.</p>

<p>"That is what I count on doing. Neither
Clare nor I will be taken to Hillsborough jail
simply because we cannot pay the poll tax."</p>

<p>"Do you know that this is treason, now the
warrants have been read?"</p>

<p>"I can well fancy that Lawyer Fanning will
twist it in that way."</p>

<p>"Not only is it treason against the king, but
you are laying yourself open to the penalties
made and provided for resisting an officer of the
colony."</p>

<p>"You cannot serve Tryon and the colony at
the same time, Master Wells, and that you know
right well. Does it so chance that you have
any weapons about you?"</p>

<p>"I am armed, as you may well see."</p>

<p>"I am more concerned to know if you have
other weapons which cannot be seen. Keep
your hands on that paper, Master Wells, while
Clare lays violent hands upon your sacred person
in order to learn to what extent you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
fitted out for taking into custody two lads whose
only crime is their lack of money."</p>

<p>"You might have been forgiven the tax; but
that which you are about to do will bring you
close to the gallows," Sandy cried in impotent
rage.</p>

<p>"Even while standing there we shall be no
nearer death than you are at this instant if
it so be you so much as raise a finger. Clare,
take away his rifle, and search him for other
weapons."</p>

<p>I lost no time in doing his bidding, for now
was Sidney Hubbard the leader and commander.</p>

<p>Sandy, the livid hue of fear yet on his cheek,
offered no resistance as I made thorough search,
bringing to light two pistols and a long knife
which would have served at a pinch as sword,
and Sidney cried derisively as I laid the weapons
at his feet:</p>

<p>"You were bravely armed, Master Wells, for
the arrest of two boys who are worth in the
eyes of Governor Tryon's law but one dollar
and a half per head, and in fact, not the value
of a penny."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall live to see you hanged!" Sandy
snarled.</p>

<p>"In which case, as I figure it, you will live to
a green old age, and it may be, suffer not a few
discomforts before you die."</p>

<p>"Now that you two villains have robbed me,
I suppose I may go my way," Master Wells
cried as Sidney lowered his rifle.</p>

<p>"Not unless your way is the same as ours, for
I am not minded to set you loose until after
learning what Captain Hamilton has to say on
the subject."</p>

<p>"What?" Sandy cried in mingled rage and
surprise. "Would you also take me prisoner?"</p>

<p>"It is no more than you would have done by
us, and surely turn about is fair play."</p>

<p>Now it was that I lost courage. The crime
of resisting one of the sheriff's officers was as
great as I felt willing to commit; but to actually
take him prisoner seemed the height of
folly.</p>

<p>Sidney seemed to read my thoughts in my
eyes, for he said quietly, thus showing himself
to be the brave soldier he afterward proved:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>"We can make matters no worse by taking
him to Master Hamilton, and it seems to me
wise that we get that gentleman's opinion before
setting this worthy officer loose to spread the tiding
of our misdeeds. Fanning and Tryon can
never overlook the fact that we have refused to
pay the tax; but I'm thinking it won't trouble
them greatly if Master Wells suffers a little discomfort."</p>

<p>Sandy began to bluster, threatening us with
the direst vengeance of his master and himself;
but Sidney soon cut the flow of words short by
saying sternly:</p>

<p>"You will mount your horse, Master Wells,
and also do well to remember that a silent
tongue oftentimes stands a man as friend."</p>

<p>Our prisoner ceased his threats, probably understanding
that Sidney's temper was none of
the best once it had been aroused, and clambered
into the saddle obediently, my comrade holding
his rifle ready for immediate use in case the
fellow made any attempt at leaving us.</p>

<p>Once Sandy had mounted, Sidney fastened his
legs beneath the animal's belly, as a precaution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
against escape, and, bringing up his own steed,
seated himself in the saddle as he slipped the
bridle of the prisoner's horse over his arm.</p>

<p>If it had been possible to do so without being
overheard by Master Wells, I would have tried
to dissuade my comrade from this last portion
of the business, for it seemed to me that by
carrying him to the rendezvous we were but
bringing additional trouble upon our own heads
without due justification. I was unwilling,
however, to let Sandy suspect that there was
any difference of opinion between us, therefore
held my tongue, meekly climbing into the saddle
when Sidney showed himself impatient to
continue the journey.</p>

<p>The one fear in my mind as we set out, Sidney
leading the way with our prisoner and I bringing
up the rear, was that Master Hamilton and
his associates would reprove us severely for
having brought the officer to the rendezvous,
for it seemed certain that Sandy would hamper
the Regulators to considerable extent.</p>

<p>However, the deed was done, and I question
whether I could have changed the situation in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
the slightest, however good an argument I might
have brought to bear. Therefore it was that I
resolved to give Sidney the leadership, obeying
his orders scrupulously, and standing by him as
a comrade should in case our actions were condemned
by the Regulation.</p>

<p>Sandy Wells evidently had no desire for conversation,
and we two lads could not speak one
with another save he heard every word, therefore
the three of us rode forward in silence,
keeping a sharp lookout both ahead and behind
lest we might inadvertently come upon one of
the officer's friends.</p>

<p>There is little need for me to set down all
the thoughts and fears which came into my mind
as we rode forward, for there is more of importance
than my timorousness to be written
before I shall come to an end of the sufferings
endured by the people of the Carolinas in that
struggle which, God be praised, finally resulted
in the freedom of this fair country.</p>

<p>It is enough if I pass over the remainder of
our journey in silence, and describe our reception
when we were in the midst of the men of Carolina
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
who, having chosen Master Hamilton as
their leader, were in the act of what Governor
Tryon was pleased to term "open rebellion."</p>

<p>The people were gathered in a thick bit of
woods near-by the highway, and we were forced
to give an account of ourselves to the sentinels
before being allowed to ride into the midst of
the large assembly, which was little less than a
veritable army.</p>

<p>The first person we saw was my father, and
toward him Sidney rode, telling our story in few
words, after which he asked:</p>

<p>"Does it please you that Master Wells be
kept a prisoner, sir?"</p>

<p>"I am at a loss to give you an answer, lad,"
my father replied in evident perplexity. "It
has only been decided that we would release
those who are confined in Hillsborough jail, and
I cannot guess how the gentleman will view
your bold act. Give him into my charge, and
we will soon have the case before the Regulation."</p>

<p>He laid hold of Sandy's bridle, leading the
horse further into the woods, while we lads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
were forced to remain where we had halted, because
of the crowd which suddenly gathered to
learn how we had chanced to come in company
with a sheriff's officer.</p>

<p>Once our story was told it could plainly be
seen that we had won the good opinion of those
who listened, for without exception each man
bestowed praise upon us, until my cheeks were
flushed a deep red from hearing myself spoken
of as a brave lad who would one day do his full
share toward freeing the Carolinas from the
money-gluttons who were impoverishing the
people.</p>

<p>Well, we were made much of, and all with
whom we spoke agreed that we should be allowed
to become members of the Regulation, as if we
were indeed men grown; but I observed with
sorrow that every one treated it as a matter of
course that we could not return to our homes
until great changes had taken place in the
colony.</p>

<p>The idea that years might elapse before I
could see my mother again had in it sufficient
to prevent me from being puffed up with pride
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
because of what was said concerning me, and
when the gentlemen were come to an end of
questioning us I unsaddled my horse, taking up
quarters at the foot of a huge gum tree.</p>

<p>In this army which had gathered responsive
to the call of Master Hamilton, there were no
tents or camp equipage of any kind. Each man
brought everything he might need, including
provisions, and the place where the Regulators
encamped had more the appearance of being
used for religious or social purposes, than as a
military rendezvous.</p>

<p>Here and there, wherever it best pleased them,
were the recruits which had been so hastily
brought together. Horses were picketed where
the best feeding places could be found, and
their owners lay under the shade of the trees,
walked as fancy dictated, or gathered in little
squads, having no care save to keep within the
lines marked out as the bounds of the encampment.</p>

<p>Twenty or more sentinels paced to and fro,
rather for the purpose of marking the limits of
the camp than because any attack was to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
apprehended, and these were not so strict in
their duty as to prevent those from straying outside
the lines who felt the inclination to do so.</p>

<p>Sidney found a friend with whom he went
away hoping to gain speech with our general,
Master Hamilton, and I remained alone a good
hour or more, when my father came up in search
of me.</p>

<p>"The prisoner will be held until after we
have marched to Hillsborough," he said by way
of explaining what had been decided upon, and
added with a sigh: "It is to be regretted that
your evil fortune brought you in Sandy Wells'
path, my son."</p>

<p>"It was he who crossed our path, sir," I said,
trying to speak in a cheery tone, although my
heart was like lead in my bosom.</p>

<p>"It recks little which way it was. What
affects us is, that you and Sidney will be forced
to remain in hiding, no one knows how long&mdash;certainly
until some arrangement can be made
to obtain pardon for what has been done."</p>

<p>"I thought the Regulators had assembled
for the purpose of taking into their own hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
the government of the colony, in which case
there can be no question but that our sins against
the person of Sandy Wells will be forgiven."</p>

<p>"It is not probable that the Regulation
will be able to effect any very radical change
in the condition of affairs. We shall march to
Hillsborough to demand the release of the prisoners,
and if they are given liberty, there is no
longer any pressing need for us to remain under
arms."</p>

<p>"Might the Regulators not also demand that
we be pardoned?" I asked, growing cold with
fear.</p>

<p>"I question if the gentlemen would be willing,
after this display of force in order to demand
justice, to ask that an offender against the
laws of the colony be forgiven."</p>

<p>"Then what is to become of us?" I cried in
fear. "Surely these gentlemen will not deliver
us up to the king's officers!"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; your deliverance must come
about without the aid of the Regulation, however.
If it becomes necessary for you to remain
in hiding, go with all speed to your uncle's home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
in Virginia, on the bank of the Dan River, and
there remain until word comes from me that
you may safely return."</p>

<p>There was no longer an opportunity for him
to give me the advice which I needed. Word
was passed from one to another that the order
had been given to begin the march toward Hillsborough,
and in a few moments all was bustle
and confusion as each member of the party
made his preparations for the journey.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the Regulators were in
line, awaiting the final word, and a goodly array
they presented. There were upwards of four
hundred horsemen, all fully armed, and at their
head Master Hamilton, a patriarch of seventy
years.</p>

<p>The word was given, and we set off at a gentle
pace, Sidney and I riding side by side, and
a short distance in advance of us, Sandy Wells,
guarded by two men.</p>

<p>The rebellion against the king's authority was
begun, and from that day we might be counted
by those in office as traitors to his majesty; but
it could never be said that there was any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
treachery in our hearts against the colony of
the Carolinas which we were ever ready to
defend with our heart's blood.</p>

<p>The march had been begun near nightfall in
order that we might arrive at Hillsborough
early in the morning, and since the distance was
but twenty miles, we were put to it to keep
the animals back, instead of trying to urge them
forward.</p>

<p>Some of the men fell asleep in their saddles;
but neither Sidney nor I had any desire for
slumber because of the disquiet in our hearts.
With the exception of Master Hamilton, who
would likely be charged with having stirred up
the people to sedition, we were in a worse plight
than the others, and whichever way the matter
turned, it was probable we must hide ourselves
in Virginia for a time.</p>

<p>With the rising of the sun our party halted
on the bank of the Eno, opposite Hillsborough,
and there discovered that the king's officers had
received news of our coming, being greatly disturbed
thereat.</p>

<p>Twenty or more men were standing near the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
edge of the river on the Hillsborough side, and
foremost among them was Attorney Fanning, he
who was equally guilty with Governor Tryon in
burdening us with taxes which were beyond
our power to pay.</p>

<p>To have seen him then, when he was in fear
of his life, one would have said that the Regulators
of the Carolinas had no warmer friend
than he. When we were drawn up in line,
waiting for the word to ford the river, Fanning
shouted, holding up a bottle of rum in one hand
and a bottle of wine in the other:</p>

<p>"We have been waiting for you, my brave
Hamilton, knowing that you will not willingly
do that which will cause blood to flow. Let's you
and I have a glass together, and decide this
troublesome business without such a warlike
parade."</p>

<p>"You may keep your liquor for those who do
not know you as well as do I," Master Hamilton
cried scornfully, and our people set up a
shout of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Master Fanning waved his hands as if asking
for silence, and after a time, when those on our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
side of the river were inclined to hear what
kind of a proposition Tryon's tool had to make,
he called out as if addressing his best friend:</p>

<p>"Send a horse over that I may cross, my
worthy Master Hamilton. I fain would give
your people some refreshments," and here he
held up the bottles again, "in addition to
having a friendly chat with you."</p>

<p>Some of our men would have made a contemptuous
reply, but the others motioned for silence
in order that Master Hamilton might act as
spokesman, which was his right.</p>

<p>"I'll send no horse," our brave leader cried.
"You're none too good to wade, and wade you
shall if you come over!"</p>

<p>I supposed Attorney Fanning would go back
to his home in anger after receiving such a
reply, and said as much to Sidney; but no
sooner had I spoken than the lawyer waded into
the stream, and over he came, holding out his
bottles as if believing that Master Hamilton
would be rejoiced at having an opportunity of
drinking with him.</p>

<p>Our leader waved him away in short order,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
and then the scheming rascal went from man to
man of the front rank, asking each to have a
glass of liquor in token of friendship; but none
would accept, and more than one gave him such
insults as a truckling knave like himself deserved.</p>

<p>Before he had come to an end of the line,
and when it must have been made plain that
not one of the Regulators cared to bestow the
commonest civility upon him, he espied Sandy
Wells.</p>

<p>"What, have you resigned your office?" the
attorney asked sharply, and our prisoner replied
whiningly:</p>

<p>"I'm held here by force, good Master Fanning,
having been taken prisoner by two lads."</p>

<p>Our people burst into laughter at this mournful
reply, and hoping, most likely, to curry
favor with the Regulators, the lawyer said with
a grin:</p>

<p>"If two lads took you prisoner, I'd advise
you to hold your tongue about it. Not many
hours since you declared yourself to be a match
for any three men in the Carolinas, providing
you were not come upon in ambush."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>"I was taken by surprise, even while reading
the warrants for their arrest, and it's by no
means to my shame, since I never dreamed they
would be bold enough to make an attack upon
the representative of our worthy sheriff."</p>

<p>"You'd best give over reading warrants,
Sandy," some person shouted, and Fanning
laughed at the gibe as he continued on along
the line of horsemen, trying in vain to find one
who would drink with him.</p>

<p>I must set down here, at risk of interfering
somewhat with the thread of the story, two
verses which were afterward written about this
effort of the attorney's to curry favor with
those who had come in the name of justice to
rescue innocent men from prison:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"At length their head man they sent out</p>
<p class="i1">To save their town from fire;</p>
<p>To see Ned Fanning wade Eno,</p>
<p class="i1">Brave boys, you'll all admire.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"With hat in hand, at our command,</p>
<p class="i1">To salute us every one, sir,</p>
<p>And after that, kept off his hat,</p>
<p class="i1">To salute old Hamilton, sir."</p>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>I must admit that the poetry is not what
might be called exceedingly fine; but it was
made next night in camp by one of our Regulators,
and because of such fact I think it well
to set it down in this story.</p>

<p>Well, bow and cringe as he might, our people
would not listen to Fanning, and Master
Hamilton told him sharply to get to the rear
lest he be trampled under the feet of the horses.</p>

<p>"We'll have neither you nor your liquor," he
cried angrily, "and unless you get out of sight
I'll not be answerable for the temper of these
good friends who have come in search of Masters
Husband and Hunter."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="s08">PROMISES.</span></h2>

<p>"The sooner we march into Hillsborough
and make an attack on the jail, the better for
the Cause," Sidney Hubbard whispered to me
when Fanning had come to understand that not
one in all our company was willing to hob-nob
with him. "To sit idly here is much like
admitting we are afraid to do that which we
have threatened, or as if we doubted the righteousness
of our mission."</p>

<p>It was not for one like me, who knew nothing
whatsoever of warfare, to criticize what
Master Hamilton might see fit to do, and yet I
held much the same opinion as did Sidney.</p>

<p>It would have been more to my liking had
we crossed the river at full speed, surrounded
the jail, and forced the keepers to deliver up
the keys without parley.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>I would have had the matter settled in one
way or another, within ten minutes, and surely
there would be no more treason in the act if
done quickly, than if we dawdled around half
a day listening to the vaporings of those who
claimed to be loyal servants of the king.</p>

<p>We were yet drawn up in line, gazing at the
town as if trying to decide whether we would go
forward or back, when Master David Edwards,
Governor Tryon's secretary, rode up opposite
us, halted an instant to view the scene properly,
and then began fording the stream.</p>

<p>"Whether yonder royalist will try to frighten
or cajole us, he is setting about the business in
proper fashion," Sidney whispered approvingly.
"He can't be accused of wasting time."</p>

<p>"Hush!" I said, laying my hand on his to
still him. "I would hear his speech with
Master Hamilton, for if I mistake not he will
settle the matter in short order, one way or
another."</p>

<p>The secretary had by this time crossed the
river and was spurring his horse toward where
Master Hamilton was posted, and as Sidney and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
I watched he saluted our commander courteously,
not in lick-spittle fashion as had Fanning.</p>

<p>"Why this war-like array, sir?" he asked,
and Master Hamilton replied:</p>

<p>"We have come for our friends who were
made prisoners even while depending upon the
governor's assurance that he wished simply to
hold a parley. It was a breach of faith not
seemly in one who represents his majesty, and
we will never brook such high-handed proceedings."</p>

<p>"In that you are to be commended, sir," the
secretary replied, speaking fair and softly; "but
I warrant you have not fully considered what
may be the result of such show of force. Your
friends have been taken into custody in what
appeared to his excellency like a lawful manner,
and it is meet they should be released with due
form, else may you plunge this fair colony into
all the horrors of civil war. For the sake of
the people, Master Hamilton, I beg of you to
withdraw, at least until his majesty's judges
have time to deliberate upon the matter."</p>

<p>"We are here, and can work our will, therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
it would be little less than folly to abandon
the advantage."</p>

<p>"You need not do so. I pledge my word as
a gentleman that all the grievances of the people
shall be redressed, if you allow this unhappy
business to be settled in lawful fashion. Retire,
and the matter will speedily be arranged as you
desire. By so doing you may avoid bloodshed
and the charges of treason."</p>

<p>"And we have your sacred word, Master
Edwards, that all this shall be done without
loss of time?" one of the party who sat near
our commander asked.</p>

<p>"Aye, sir," the secretary cried, raising his voice
that all might hear, "the affair shall be inquired
into as soon as may be."</p>

<p>"There are other matters that need attention,
sir," Master Hamilton said stoutly. "Money
has been extorted by Edward Fanning, from
very many here, and without color of lawfulness."</p>

<p>"Master Fanning shall answer to the judges
of this colony, and, if found guilty of illegal
proceedings, will be punished as should be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
lowest of our citizens," Master Edwards cried,
holding up his right hand as if taking a solemn
oath.</p>

<p>"And will you also pledge yourself that whatsoever
has been done by those who belong to
the Regulation, in the effort to gain redress,
remains in abeyance until the first question has
been settled?" our commander asked, and the
secretary replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Here is one of your tax-collectors who, while
attempting to arrest two lads, was himself made
prisoner," and Master Hamilton pointed toward
Sandy Wells. "Such resistance might be given
the name of treason, if you were inclined to play
us false."</p>

<p>"The act shall pass as if it had never been
committed, provided that you release your
prisoner. Go to your homes, and at the earliest
possible moment Governor Tryon will take
the necessary steps to have all this unhappy
business disposed of to your satisfaction."</p>

<p>Master Hamilton wheeled his horse around,
and, addressing our party, cried:</p>

<p>"You hear, gentlemen all, what the representative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
of the governor has promised in the
name of his master. Are you agreed to do as he
proposes to the end that bloodshed may be
averted?"</p>

<p>"We are agreed," our people cried as if with
one voice, and an instant later Sandy Wells was
allowed to ride out from among the party, when
he forded the river hurriedly as if fearing some
one might try to hold him back.</p>

<p>"We yet have his weapons as spoils of war,"
Sidney said gleefully to me, "and I warrant you
he will not venture near Alamance for many days
to come."</p>

<p>"Think you we shall go free after having
raised our hands against him?" I asked, hardly
able to believe that such good fortune might be
ours.</p>

<p>"We have the secretary's solemn word for it,"
Sidney replied, and he had no more than spoken
when the command was given for our people to
wheel about in the direction of Maddock's Mill.</p>

<p>The return was made at a rapid pace, and
when we were arrived at this place a general halt
was called, the assembly being told that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Regulation would be in session at George Sally's
house next day "to consult upon the public
good."</p>

<p>Sidney and I thought just then more about
our own bodies than the burning questions of
the hour, and after taking care of our horses we
camped in a grove near the mill, with nothing
save the bushes to shelter us from dew and
sun.</p>

<p>We slept nearly eighteen hours, which atoned
for the repose that was lost during the march to
Hillsborough, and then, on the morning after our
appearance before Hillsborough, were ready to
discuss the condition of the "rebellion."</p>

<p>That we were included in the truce was a
matter of rejoicing, for it had seemed certain
we would become fugitives, hiding on the Dan
River; but both of us decided that it would not
be well to venture within reach of Sandy Wells,
unless we were so well armed as to be able to care
for ourselves.</p>

<p>As a matter of course we two lads went to
George Sally's with the Regulators, but neither
of us ventured to take any part in the proceedings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
although much was done of which we did
not approve.</p>

<p>In the first place the Regulation prepared a
petition to be presented to Governor Tryon,
begging that Messrs. Husband and Hunter be
speedily released in accordance with the promise
made by Master Edwards; that the taxes of
those who, by reason of their poverty, could not
raise the required amount of money, be abated;
and that Master Fanning and other court officers
be restrained from oppressing the people by
exorbitant fees whenever a legal document was
required or served.</p>

<p>As I chanced to know full well, neither
my father nor Master Hamilton approved such
a course as pleading with the governor after
showing his minions that the Regulation was
sufficiently strong to make demands; but the
majority of the gentlemen were in favor of
proving that the Regulators were not disposed to
transgress the laws, and the petition was written
out by Malichi Tyke, who had once served as
clerk of courts.</p>

<p>Sidney and I were both very much dissatisfied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
with the turn of affairs, although we took good
care not to give words to our discontent in the
hearing of the gentlemen who formed the Regulation.</p>

<p>In our opinion we should have encamped
near about Hillsborough until all which Master
Edwards promised had been performed, for
Governor Tryon could better be moved by a
show of force than an humble petition.</p>

<p>However, as Sidney wisely said, it was no
real concern of ours, since the elders of the association
would contrive to manage affairs after
their own fashion, without giving overly much
heed to boys or hot-heads, and if we wished to
be numbered among the Regulators it stood us
in hand to obey the voice of the majority without
grumbling.</p>

<p>It was also decided at this meeting in George
Sally's barn, that Masters Rednap Howell and
James Hunter be appointed deputies of the
Regulation to present the petition to Governor
Tryon, and that they set out at once for Brunswick,
where his excellency then was.</p>

<p>Now the upper Carolina was not in as peaceful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
a state as could have been desired. Some
of the more wealthy inhabitants favored the
representatives of the king, and upheld them
in all their iniquitous proceedings; calling
themselves royalists, and us of the Regulation
rebels. They oftentimes, when a fair opportunity
presented itself, took the right to discipline
the people who grumbled against the money-gluttons.</p>

<p>It was not impossible that some of these
aristocrats might meet our deputies, and, being
the stronger in numbers, attempt to prevent
them from appearing before Tryon, therefore
to put a check upon such a possibility it was
decided that at least two others should accompany
Masters Howell and Hunter.</p>

<p>It was my father who proposed that Sidney
and I be chosen as the escort, giving as a reason
why we two lads should be selected, that it was
possible, despite the promise of Master Edwards,
Sandy Wells might try to make trouble for
us because of our taking him prisoner. It
was better, so he urged, that we be kept out of
sight until the Regulation had accomplished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
its work, and by accompanying the deputies to
Brunswick, Sandy would not readily find us.</p>

<p>Master Howell himself seconded the proposition,
kindly stating that he desired no abler
escort than our two selves, and thus was the
matter settled, much to my satisfaction, even
though there was more than the shadow of a
suspicion in my mind as to the reception with
which we might meet.</p>

<p>The Regulation also decided that we four
should set out as soon as Master Malichi Tyke
had made a fair copy of the petition, and he
was so expeditious with the work that everything
was in readiness for our departure on the
following morning.</p>

<p>We had before us a ride of about two hundred
miles, and to Sidney and me, who had
never before traveled an eighth part of that distance
from home, the journey offered much in
the way of novelty.</p>

<p>There were no preparations to be made save
saddling our horses: we would sleep wheresoever
night overtook us, and procure food at such
dwellings as we came across, or, failing in this,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
depend upon finding game enough to satisfy our
wants.</p>

<p>"Remember that Masters Howell and Hunter
are to be obeyed strictly by you, lads," my
father said to us as we were saddling the steeds,
"and do not put me to shame by behaving
other than as gentlemen."</p>

<p>As a matter of course we promised faithfully
to heed his words, and with high anticipations
set off, riding immediately behind those whom
we were supposed to guard.</p>

<p>During this first day, when we were yet within
our own home neighborhood, the ride was
without especial incident, save that at nightfall,
when we were encamped in a lean-to which
Sidney and I had put up while the gentlemen
were cooking a couple of hares I had killed late
in the afternoon, Master Howell amused himself
with writing the verses I shall set down
below, and which I afterward saw in a pamphlet
entitled "A Fan for Fanning," that had
been printed in Boston in 1771:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"When Fanning first to Orange came,</p>
<p class="i1">He looked both pale and wan;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>
<p>An old patched coat upon his back&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">An old mare he rode on.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Both man and mare wa'n't worth five pounds,</p>
<p class="i1">As I've been often told,</p>
<p>But by his civil robberies</p>
<p class="i1">He's laced his coat with gold."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>When these lines had been read to us Master
Hunter declared that it was no more than right
Master Howell should touch up Thomas Frohock,
who, as clerk of the Superior Court in
Salisbury, had done quite as much as Fanning
to extort money from the people, and then it
was that our deputy wrote these verses, which
were afterward published in the same pamphlet
of which I have spoken:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Says Fanning to Frohock, to tell the plain truth,</p>
<p>When I came to this country I was but a youth;</p>
<p>Me father sent for me; I wa'n't worth a cross,</p>
<p>And then my first study was to steal for a horse.</p>
<p>I quickly got credit, and then ran away,</p>
<p>And haven't paid for him to this very day.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Says Fanning to Frohock, 'tis a folly to lie;</p>
<p>I rode an old mare that was blind of an eye;</p>
<p>Five shillings in money I had in my purse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>
<p>My coat it was patched, but not much the worse:</p>
<p>But now we've got rich, and 'tis very well known</p>
<p>That we'll do very well if they'll let us alone."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Master Howell laughingly said that as poetry
the verses were of little account; but the sentiment
could not be bettered, according to my
ideas, and before we went to sleep that night I
could repeat the lines without missing a word.</p>

<p>We set out on our journey next morning
shortly after sunrise, and, just before noon,
when we were looking for a place in which to
camp, two men, attended by a negro slave, undertook
to make us explain our business.</p>

<p>The whites had halted in the middle of the
road, with the black immediately behind them,
and when we advanced made a great showing
of pistols.</p>

<p>"Halt, gentlemen, and make us acquainted
with your destination and your purpose in
traveling this way!" one of them cried peremptorily,
and in a twinkling Sidney and I, who
were slightly in the rear of the deputies, had
our rifles ready for use.</p>

<p>"Why shall we make explanations to you or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
any other in the Carolinas?" Master Hunter
cried angrily.</p>

<p>"Fair and softly, good sir," the spokesman
said, looking well to the priming of his weapon.
"We are told that there are in the Carolinas
those who speak against his majesty the king,
and with such as they we would have a few
words."</p>

<p>"Except we are so minded, you will have no
words with us," Master Howell said sharply,
and I observed that he was fingering his revolver
as if itching to draw it from the holster.</p>

<p>"You will at least explain from what part of
the colony you have lately come," the stranger
said, this time speaking in a more gentle tone.</p>

<p>"I am willing to give you so much information
as that; but no more, for I deny that any
person, save the king's representatives, have the
right to question me. We are lately from
Hillsborough."</p>

<p>The two strangers exchanged glances, and he
who had first spoken said quietly:</p>

<p>"I have heard that the good people near
there talk of banding together to resist the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
king's officers in their duty of collecting lawful
taxes."</p>

<p>"It can now be seen how much the governor's
secretary meant when he gave us such fair
promises," Sidney whispered. "Edwards himself
has sent these fellows in advance to prevent
us from going to Brunswick."</p>

<p>There was much the same thought in my own
mind; but I made no answer just then, for the
very good reason that Master Hunter was replying
to what was little less than a question.</p>

<p>"Our people have banded together; but it is
for the purpose of declaring ourselves against
<i>unlawful</i> taxation."</p>

<p>"And you are one of the so-called Regulators,
I may suppose?" the stranger said with a sneer.</p>

<p>Sidney and I moved nearer until we were almost
side by side with our deputies, for now did
it seem certain that we were fallen upon those
who would make trouble.</p>

<p>"We have not come out either for the purpose
of discussing politics with strangers, or indulging
in a brawl," Master Hunter said stoutly,
drawing his pistols deliberately. "It is our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
purpose to ride forward without too great delay,
and if you oppose us the blood which is
shed will be upon your heads."</p>

<p>"Might it not interest you to know who we
are?" the stranger asked menacingly.</p>

<p>"Not a whit; <i>we</i> are peaceful travelers who
pursue our journey without molesting any man
who does not seek a brawl. We shall go forward
at whatever cost."</p>

<p>Now it was that I believed a fight would be
begun in a twinkling, and my rifle was raised,
ready to do my share, when we heard the trampling
of horses' hoofs in the distance.</p>

<p>"There is some treachery afoot," Master
Howell said in a low tone. "These fellows
have kept us in conversation until the remainder
of the party can come up. It would be useless
to oppose an overwhelming force."</p>

<p>"True," Master Hunter added, and then, as
if seized by a sudden thought, he added in a
low tone to me, who sat nearest him, "You two
lads may perchance escape and carry to our
companions of the association the information of
our trouble. Back your horses off till you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
partially screened by the trees, and then ride at
full speed."</p>

<p>"There are four of us, and each one ready to
give a good account of himself," Sidney said,
much as if he was eager to take part in a fray
where blood must inevitably be spilled.</p>

<p>"Do not stop to argue, lad. It is necessary
the Regulation know that our passage is barred
by some treachery of Edwards and Fanning,
and you must carry the news."</p>

<p>I remembered what my father had said, and
pulled my horse back, step by step, until he was
amid the bushes that bordered the road on
either side.</p>

<p>The strangers gave but little heed to my maneuvers,
probably because they believed that a
lad like me was of but little importance as compared
with the deputies&mdash;I had no doubt but
that they were acquainted with the purpose of
Masters Howell and Hunter&mdash;and, therefore,
I was soon partially screened from view.</p>

<p>Sidney delayed until a party of horsemen
numbering four or five came into view, and
then he wheeled around suddenly, riding at full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
speed past me as a couple of pistol balls whistled
by his head.</p>

<p>I joined him, as may be supposed, and we
rode at a sharp pace for a mile or more, when
we pulled up as if by common consent.</p>

<p>No chase had been given, and thus was I
all the more strongly convinced that these highwaymen
knew full well who were acting as
deputies of the Regulation.</p>

<p>We two lads looked at each other in silence
as our horses came to a standstill, and not until
perhaps a minute had passed did we speak.</p>

<p>"The Regulators did well to listen to such
knaves as Edwards and Fanning!" Sidney
said angrily. "We should have released the
prisoners when it was in our power. Now the
poor men will remain in jail until the brute
Tryon gets tired of holding them."</p>

<p>"It is childish to cry over spilled milk!" I
replied, angry because my comrade was inclined
to give way to repinings when they could be of
no avail. "It is our duty to get speech with
Master Hamilton without delay."</p>

<p>"Yes," Sidney cried scornfully, "and while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
we are riding toward Maddock's Mill, where I
question if any of the Regulators can be found,
those scoundrels will carry our companions to
some jail in which they may die before we
learn of their whereabouts."</p>

<p>"We can only do as Master Hunter commanded,"
I replied meekly, realizing the truth
of all Sidney had said.</p>

<p>"I don't count on anything of the kind; but
intend to turn back."</p>

<p>"To what purpose?" I cried, now thoroughly
alarmed, for I knew my comrade well enough
to understand that he did not make such assertions
without fully intending to carry out
whatever plan might be in his head.</p>

<p>"It stands to reason that those fellows who
have taken the deputies prisoners came from
near about Hillsborough, in which case they
will camp somewhere on the road to-night. It
is not probable they count two lads as of any
great importance, and will never suspect us of
coming back once we get away."</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked, determined that he should
unfold his scheme without assistance from me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall turn back, follow those fellows if
possible, and try to come upon them unawares
to-night, when there should be a chance to aid
our friends."</p>

<p>"Suppose you fail?" I asked, turning over
in my mind the possibilities of his being able
to accomplish anything of importance.</p>

<p>"If I find that they are on the alert against
a rescue, or if there are too many, it will yet be
time to turn my horse's head toward Maddock's
Mill."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="s08">THE RESCUE.</span></h2>

<p>When Sidney had thus announced his purpose
I asked myself what might be the chances
of success, and after due reflection it appeared
to me as if the possibilities were rather in his
favor, because it did not seem probable the royalists
would anticipate any attempt at a rescue.</p>

<p>They must have overheard the command given
us to ride back with all speed, and could hardly
suppose two lads like ourselves would take the
chances of making an attack, therefore we were
likely to find them off their guard.</p>

<p>Yes, so I decided, the scheme might be worked
if we proceed cautiously, and even in case we
found it impossible to do anything, the delay
would be trifling, provided Sidney was willing
to give over the effort if a rescue could not be
brought about that same night, therefore I asked:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you agree to set your horse's head toward
Maddock's Mill by sunrise, in case you
fail in the purpose during this night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that much I promise, for I'm of the
opinion that unless the work can be done before
to-morrow morning there is no chance for us to
carry it through without assistance."</p>

<p>"Then I shall do what I may toward aiding
you."</p>

<p>He clasped me by the hand, saying as he did
so:</p>

<p>"I knew full well you would not ride away
and leave me to make the venture alone."</p>

<p>"I am taking no part in it save as your
assistant. You are the leader, and I shall
simply obey orders, because I have no head for
such work, while you are a born soldier."</p>

<p>Sidney laughed loud and long at my words,
and said when it was possible for him to speak:</p>

<p>"Now you are talking nonsense. If we free
Masters Howell and Hunter from the governor's
friends, it will simply be a case of good fortune,
rather than anything deserved because of the
intellect brought to bear on the matter. Let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
us make camp here for a time; the horses need
rest and food."</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid that our enemies will
get too much the start on us?"</p>

<p>"I am reckoning that we were near their
camping-place when the two showed themselves.
If they count on carrying our friends back to
Hillsborough to give them quarters with Masters
Husband and William Hunter, this road is the
one they must take, and we shall see the party
ride by. In case they have a comfortable halting
place, I am counting that the return journey
will not be begun until to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>I understood from this remark that Sidney
had already settled all the details in his mind,
and, therefore, since I refused to take any part
in making his plans, there was nothing for me
to do save patiently hold my tongue.</p>

<p>We unsaddled the horses, led them into the
forest where was a small clearing covered with
rich grass, and made a hearty dinner for ourselves
from the contents of our haversacks.</p>

<p>When this was done we had nothing with
which to occupy our attention, save the task of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
keeping watch over the highway to make certain
the enemy did not pass without our knowledge.</p>

<p>Although I had so readily agreed to aid my
comrade, I was far from feeling comfortable in
mind regarding the outcome. I knew full well
that even in event of success we must run many
chances of losing our lives, for now that the
royalists had begun to make prisoners of citizens
of the Carolinas without legal warrant, they
would not hesitate to take the lives of two lads
who might interfere with their plans.</p>

<p>To risk our lives in a battle where glory
might be won, was one thing; but to be killed
like thieves in the night, when none of our
friends would be able to say whether we died like
heroes or cowards was quite another matter.</p>

<p>Do not let it be understood that I was regretting
having agreed to the venture; on the contrary,
I would have acted in the same manner
had the question been put at that late moment,
yet I weighed the possibilities once more, and
found them less promising than when first considering
the proposition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>We did not indulge in conversation to any
extent during that afternoon. Now and then
Sidney spoke of the treachery displayed by
Master Edwards, and the possible fate of the
deputies in case we failed to rescue them; but
for the greater portion of the time we remained
silent, each giving way, perhaps, to gloomy forebodings.</p>

<p>The sun was no more than an hour high when
my comrade said as he rose to his feet and set
off toward the clearing where the horses had
been left:</p>

<p>"I reckon the time has come for us to make
a start. We'll ride to the place where the villains
met us, and then you shall take to the
woods with the horses, while I follow the trail
on foot."</p>

<p>"Why should we not boldly ride down the
road until we find ourselves somewhere near
their camping-place?" I asked, even after having
promised myself to take no part in the plan
of rescue.</p>

<p>"Because I'm of the opinion that we shall
find the villains within half a mile or less of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
where we were halted, and it would be a most
serious mistake to let them see us."</p>

<p>As he had proposed so we did, and I soon
had good reason for congratulating myself that
my advice was not taken.</p>

<p>The hoof-prints of the horses told us plainly
when we were come to the scene of the encounter,
and then, leading both animals, I struck
into the woods, advancing slowly because of the
underbrush, while my comrade pushed rapidly
ahead.</p>

<p>The night had not yet come when Sidney
returned, and as I involuntarily came to a halt
he whispered:</p>

<p>"They are camped half a mile further on.
There are six horses picketed near by, in addition
to those ridden by the deputies, therefore I
reckon that the odds are not heavily against us."</p>

<p>"Did you see our friends?"</p>

<p>"Yes; they are in a lean-to, tied, and guarded
by the negro. We can take the horses within
two hundred yards of the place, where is a good
bit of grass which will keep them quiet; but it
is well to wait here a couple of hours."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>Once more we came to a halt, and while waiting
until the time for action should come I asked
Sidney to tell me how he proposed to set about
the rescue.</p>

<p>"I shall find no fault with your plans, for you
are the leader; but it is necessary I know fully
your purpose, in order to play my part properly."</p>

<p>"We'll leave our horses hobbled, so that we
may unfasten them quickly. Then, say in two
hours, you and I are to creep around to where
their animals are tethered. We must procure
two, with saddles and bridles, and bring them
to where ours are. Not till then are we to give
the deputies any idea of our having disobeyed
orders. We should be able to get them away
safely, and a start of five minutes will be enough.
The rising of the moon is to be our signal for
work."</p>

<p>"What about the negro who is on guard?"</p>

<p>"Unless he is different from every other
black I ever saw, he will be asleep. If not, or
if one of the white men has taken his place, we
must fall upon him in such a way that he can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
make no noise, after which a gag will do the
rest."</p>

<p>"Where are the others?"</p>

<p>"In a lean-to nearer the road, and a good
fifty yards from where our friends are lying."</p>

<p>The two hours which followed were the
longest I have ever known, although since that
time I have been engaged in many and more
dangerous ventures. Each second seemed like a
minute, and I began to think that we had been
mistaken in the belief that the moon rose at ten
minutes past nine o'clock. The soughing of the
wind through the trees sounded in my ears like
a prophecy of evil, and the cry of a night-bird
came to me like the shout of an enemy.</p>

<p>Had we been forced to remain there inactive
an hour longer, I believe of a verity that the
courage would have oozed out of my finger-ends
entirely; but, fortunately, before I was overcome
by timorousness the time for action had arrived.</p>

<p>Sidney led the way through the underbrush,
gliding noiselessly along as if we were stalking
a deer, and I copied his every movement.</p>

<p>In order to get at the horses we were forced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
make a detour through the forest to the rear of
the place where the deputies were held prisoners,
and this required a good half hour of most
laborious work.</p>

<p>Once we were there, however, it became
evident that the royalists counted on beginning
a journey very shortly, for the animals were not
only saddled, but bridled, and we understood
that the remainder of our task must be performed
quickly, or it might chance that our enemies
took to the road before we could warn Masters
Howell and Hunter of the help which was near
at hand.</p>

<p>Now we did not dare carry our plan to the
extent of taking the animals over to where our
steeds were hobbled; but fastened them by the
bridles in the rear of the lean-to, and then crept
cautiously forward.</p>

<p>It was so dark in this place, owing to the
foliage, that although the moon was half an inch
high, we could not distinguish objects five paces
distant, and Sidney let the way by the sense of
touch, rather than because of any aid from his
eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>When we were close at the rear of the lean-to
I could hear the sound of heavy breathing;
but nothing more, and Sidney whispered in my
ear:</p>

<p>"I will make my way through the brush, and
you are to wait here. If I should be captured,
do your best to carry the information to Maddock's
Mill. Don't try to aid me."</p>

<p>I made up my mind on the instant that I
would do my full share in a fight before leaving
the brave lad to his fate, and as the thought
formed itself in my mind he disappeared through
the branches which went to make up the shelter.</p>

<p>I listened with painful intentness; but could
hear no more than a faint rustling of the brush,
and then a man crept slowly out into my arms.</p>

<p>It was Master Howell, and when I would
have conducted him to where the horses were
tethered, he motioned for me to remain quiet.</p>

<p>Another moment of most painful suspense,
during which my heart beat so loudly that it
seemed certain our enemies would be aroused by
the noise, and then Master Hunter appeared,
followed closely by Sidney.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>We four crept softly to where the two horses
were standing, and my comrade explained to the
deputies that we must keep within the thicket
until having come to where our steeds had been
left.</p>

<p>"We had best turn in the other direction,
keeping under cover until you ride by, when we
can dash out," Master Howell said, and I was
mystified by his words.</p>

<p>"But we shall not ride past here," Sidney
replied in a cautious tone. "To do so would
be going directly away from Maddock's Mill!"</p>

<p>"Our destination is Brunswick," Master
Howell said, as if that was sufficient explanation.</p>

<p>"Brunswick!" I repeated in astonishment.
"Surely you are not counting on trying to continue
the journey after all that has happened?"</p>

<p>"Of a verity we are," Master Hunter said
emphatically. "It is not in our minds to ride
back with the story that we allowed ourselves
to be frightened by six men after two lads have
shown themselves so brave and so quick-witted.
Go for your horses, and, having mounted them,
ride directly out on the main road, moving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
cautiously until arriving opposite where these
scoundrels are encamped. Then use your spurs;
we will join you some distance on."</p>

<p>"But think of the danger which you incur!"
I pleaded, although it would have been more
seemly for a lad like myself to keep a silent
tongue and obey orders.</p>

<p>"We count on presenting this petition to the
governor if it be possible to arrive at Brunswick,"
Master Howell said sharply, and then, by way
of putting an end to the conversation, the gentlemen
began leading the animals back past the
lean-to from which we had so lately rescued them.</p>

<p>There was nothing left for Sidney and I but
to perform the parts assigned us, although I am
certain there was much the same thought in his
mind that filled mine, which was that the latter
portion of this venture would be needlessly
dangerous and ill-advised.</p>

<p>We did not speak one with another, however,
until we had found our horses and made them
ready for the journey, when Sidney said solemnly:</p>

<p>"If I had fancied the deputies would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
continued on toward Brunswick, of a verity we
would be well toward Maddock's Mill by this
time. Even if we two get past the camp in
safety, we're likely to fall into the hands of
others who are ready and willing to deprive
honest men of their liberty."</p>

<p>But for the fact that the deputies awaited our
coming as the signal for them to come out of
the forest into the road, I would have urged my
comrade to leave them then and there that we
might save our own skins by joining the members
of the Regulation, wherever they might be
by this time.</p>

<p>Then, feeling in our hearts that there was
no good reason for exposing ourselves to this
additional danger, we led the steeds down the
road to a point, as nearly as Sidney could
determine, opposite the encampment of the
enemies.</p>

<p>We mounted in silence, and loosened our
weapons that they might be ready to hand, after
which Sidney started with a rush.</p>

<p>It can well be fancied that I clapped the
spurs to my horse, for the hindermost in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
race was likely to be the one who would suffer
severely, and we clattered past the camp at the
best possible speed.</p>

<p>When a mile or more had been traversed we
heard the hoof-beats of horses both before and
behind, telling that the deputies had taken to
the road, and also that the royalists were in
full pursuit.</p>

<p>Masters Howell and Hunter must have
checked the speed of their steeds somewhat in
order to allow us to come up, after which all
four settled down to such a race as I never rode
before, for liberty, perhaps like itself, was the
stake.</p>

<p>Not until our horses were so nearly blown
that it became absolutely necessary, did we
draw rein, and then it was no longer possible to
hear the sounds of pursuit.</p>

<p>"We have out-ridden them, that is all,"
Master Howell said in a quiet tone, as if he
was not greatly interested in the final result.
"We will give the nags time to breathe, and
then push on again. For a time our traveling
must be done by night."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>"If you count so surely that there are others
on the road who will try to prevent us from
gaining Brunswick, why is it not reasonable to
suppose Governor Tryon may play us false?"
I asked timidly, for I feared the gentlemen
might think me a coward, and yet was I determined
they should discuss the possible dangers
which awaited us at the journey's end.</p>

<p>"I think it very likely he will treat us as
rebels rather than deputies," Master Howell
replied quietly.</p>

<p>"And yet you make every effort to give him
the opportunity?" I cried in dismay.</p>

<p>"Aye, lad. We accepted the mission, and
having done so it became our bounden duty to
perform it whatever might be the result. Before
the people of the Carolinas can force the
representatives of the king to treat us fairly
and honestly, many a good gentleman must
come to grief, and it is not for us to hold
back."</p>

<p>There was no reply to be made to such a
remark as this, and I would have held my peace
but that the gentlemen insisted on being told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
why we had worked to rescue them, instead of
pushing on toward Maddock's Mill.</p>

<p>"All the credit belongs to Sidney," I replied,
determined that my comrade should have the
praise. He argued that we would be wasting
but little time by trying to effect a rescue, and
in case of failure we could have carried out your
orders within six hours from the moment they
were given.</p>

<p>Sidney claimed that he could not have made
the attempt unless I had been willing to remain
with him, and regarding this we fell into quite
a discussion, which lasted until we heard once
more the trampling of horses in the distance.</p>

<p>It was high time we continued the race, and,
the horses having had quite a breathing spell, we
sent them ahead once more at their best pace.</p>

<p>After this we stopped twice to give the animals
water, and once to breathe them, before
the gray light told that a new day was upon us.</p>

<p>Then it was that Master Howell proposed
we take to the thicket, and after we were
screened by the trees we led the horses a mile
or more parallel with the road. Then we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
crossed over to the other side, taking good care
to cover such hoof-prints as had been left on the
highway.</p>

<p>After these precautions it seemed as if we
might consider ourselves reasonably well hidden
from those who came in pursuit, and surely I
was not sorry of an opportunity for rest.</p>

<p>We had been in the saddle not less than
eighteen hours, and during six or seven hours
more were so strung up by excitement that it
was as if we had been two days without repose.</p>

<p>Fortunately the deputies had not been despoiled
of their haversacks when taken prisoners,
therefore we had food sufficient to provide
us with one hearty meal, and this we ate immediately
after the horses were picketed where
was grass in abundance.</p>

<p>Not until we were eating did Sidney ask
Masters Howell and Hunter anything concerning
their adventure, and soon we were in possession
of all the facts.</p>

<p>The deputies, finding themselves opposed by
six horsemen, surrendered immediately after
Sidney and I rode away. They were asked no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
questions, nor was there an attempt to search
them. The royalist led the prisoners to the
lean-to, tied their hands and feet, and left them
in charge of the negro, giving orders for him to
shoot with intent to kill if either made any
effort to cry out for help in case travelers passed
that way.</p>

<p>Neither Master Howell nor Master Hunter
had any definite idea as to what the scoundrels
intended to do with them; but both believed
that but for the rescue they would have been
taken to Hillsborough and there lodged in jail
on a charge of sedition or treason.</p>

<p>"Yes, I recognized one of them," Master
Howell said in reply to my question. "He who
appeared to be the leader I have seen in Fanning's
office, therefore there was no question in
my mind but that the party set out from Hillsborough
in advance of us. Some one at Maddock's
Mill played the traitor."</p>

<p>"Why did they wish to prevent you from
presenting the petition to Governor Tryon?"
I asked in amazement.</p>

<p>"I do not believe that was their purpose. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
could make but little difference if Tryon heard
of our wrongs; but it might create a sentiment
in our favor among the honest people of Brunswick
if we told there what has occurred at
Hillsborough. The scheme unquestionably was
to prevent information of the outrages being
carried into the lower Carolina."</p>

<p>"Do you think we are in danger from others?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Probably not, yet we will travel by night
from this out in order to guard against a possible
attack. If those fellows sent word ahead
that we were on the road and must be stopped,
then will there be men ready to detain us; but
I am disposed to think that they believed it
was in their power to bring our journey to a
close, and we shall meet with no serious impediment
between here and Brunswick."</p>

<p>"The governor may close our mouths by
sending us to prison as traitors to the king,"
Sidney suggested.</p>

<p>"We shall take good care, my lad, to talk
with many citizens of Brunswick before presenting
ourselves before him. If it is known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
generally that we are in town as deputies from
the Regulation, who have come in consequence
of certain promises made by the governor's secretary,
I do not believe even William Tryon will
dare cause our arrest without first showing some
proof that we are plotting against the king.
He will commit deeds in Hillsborough which
he would be afraid to commit in Brunswick or
Newbern."</p>

<p>"In other words," Master Hunter added with
a laugh, "we are thrusting our heads in the
lion's mouth because we believe he dare not
make a meal of us until after we have gone
back into upper Carolina."</p>

<p>With this the conversation came to a close.
Master Howell insisted that we must get all the
sleep possible before nightfall, and to such end
he proposed that we draw lots to decide who
should first go on guard, after which the others
were to lie down.</p>

<p>No one questioned the necessity of standing
watch. In the first place the horses were to be
prevented from straying, and then again it was
of the highest importance we should know if a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
party of horsemen rode past our camping place
toward Brunswick, otherwise we might find
ourselves following the enemy, instead of being
followed.</p>

<p>It was decided by lot that I take the first
watch, and at the end of two hours Master
Howell was to be aroused.</p>

<p>Those who had the privilege of sleeping soon
stretched themselves out in the most comfortable
positions that were possible, and ten minutes
later I was the only member of the party
awake.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="s08">AT BRUNSWICK.</span></h2>

<p>During my time of standing sentinel I neither
saw nor heard anything to cause alarm or suspicion;
but I never had a harder task than that
of keeping my eyes open while the others were
sleeping. It was as if until my companions lost
themselves in slumber I had no sense of weariness,
and then, suddenly, I was overcome to
such an extent that it seemed almost impossible
I could perform the duties of sentry.</p>

<p>I walked to and fro briskly; repeated to myself
this hymn or that verse, and now and then
groomed the horses in the hope of arousing myself;
but all to no purpose. My eyelids drooped
as if weighted with lead, and not until I had
switched my face sharply with a bit of brush,
striking my bare eyeball inadvertently, was I
awakened. Then the pain kept me awake until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
I judged that the time of my vigil had come to
an end.</p>

<p>Master Howell arose reluctantly when I shook
him vigorously, and asked as he stretched his
limbs and yawned prodigiously, whether I had
heard anything which might concern us.</p>

<p>Sixty seconds later I was sleeping soundly,
and not until late in the afternoon was I sensible
that the life yet remained within my tired
body.</p>

<p>Then I was surprised by seeing meat cooking
before a fire; but soon learned that Master
Hunter had been out in search of game, and,
fortunately for us, had come across a deer within
half a mile of our camping place.</p>

<p>After partaking of a hearty meal the difficulties
and dangers of our way seemed to have
lessened, and I looked forward to the night's
work as a task which might have within it somewhat
of pleasure.</p>

<p>Because we had not heard horsemen passing
our resting-place, it was believed that our enemies
had abandoned the chase, and immediately
the late dinner was eaten we set forth, taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
less precautions than before, for now it seemed
as if we must have outrun danger.</p>

<p>In order that I may not make too many words
of what is of little consequence, no further record
of the journey shall be made, save to say
that on a certain day, near about noon, we
rode into Brunswick despite the efforts of
Master Edwards and Attorney Fanning to
check us.</p>

<p>At the inn, the landlord of which was an acquaintance
of Master Howell's, it was given out
with considerable emphasis, as if there was something
in our official position of which to be proud,
that we had come as deputies from the Regulation
to petition the governor, and I venture to
say that before nightfall every citizen of Brunswick
was well aware of what had been done in
upper Carolina to preserve the rights of the
people.</p>

<p>It was only natural the Brunswickers should
be curious to know all that this association so
lately sprung into existence was doing, and even
we lads were questioned eagerly by those who,
because of press of numbers around the deputies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
could not otherwise learn of the organized resistance
against unjust taxation.</p>

<p>Thus it came about as Master Howell and
Hunter desired, that the citizens were well informed
as to the reason of our coming before we
had asked for an audience with the representative
of his majesty in the Carolinas.</p>

<p>Not until the following morning did we present
ourselves at the governor's residence, and then we
were admitted after being allowed to cool our
heels in the guard-room for an hour or more.</p>

<p>Sidney and I had not supposed that we would
accompany our companions on this visit of state;
but it served the purpose of our gentlemen to
introduce us as deputies of equal importance
with themselves, with the view, most likely, of
giving us lads that fancied protection which
would be thrown around the messengers of a
reasonably powerful association.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt but that the governor
knew by this time why we had visited
Brunswick, and, while not daring, perhaps, to
refuse us an audience, satisfied his narrow mind
and tyrannical disposition by making us wait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
in the room occupied by the guard for a certain
length of time.</p>

<p>When finally we were admitted to his presence
we saw a cruel-faced man, clad carelessly
in a dressing-gown, seated at a table in that room
which served him as a library, and ranged around
the apartment were six soldiers fully armed,
fitting protectors for such as he.</p>

<p>As if with the view of proving that we were
of but little consequence in comparison with his
greatness, he did not so much as glance at us
when we first entered; but remained as if engrossed
with certain papers that were spread
out on the table, until ten minutes or more had
elapsed, when he looked up, surveying us with
a scornful expression.</p>

<p>Certain it is that he did not frighten either of
the party by his lordly manner, and such fact
must have been apparent on our faces, for he
finally asked in a loud voice, perhaps hoping to
cause alarm by his roar, why we had presented
ourselves.</p>

<p>Master Howell acted as spokesman, and he
advanced a pace as he said boldly:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>"May it please your excellency, we, the deputies
of a certain association well known in
upper Carolina as the Regulation, have ventured
to present ourselves with a petition from the
Regulators, on the strength of a recommendation
from your excellency's secretary, Master David
Edwards."</p>

<p>"Your association may be well known in the
backwoods; but we have yet to learn of it
here," the governor cried angrily.</p>

<p>"That you may do by a perusal of this petition,
your excellency," Master Howell said quietly as
he laid a folded paper on the table in front of
Tryon. "Two of our people have been imprisoned
without due warrant, and when four
hundred or more gentlemen of upper Carolina
presented themselves at Hillsborough for the
purpose of restoring our friends to liberty,
Master Edwards urged us to the present procedure,
promising faithfully in your name that
this matter, together with others of an unlawful
nature, should receive your prompt attention."</p>

<p>At this speech, which savored little of fear, the
governor took up the petition, glancing at it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
carelessly, and then throwing it contemptuously
on the table, cried in a voice which quivered
with passion:</p>

<p>"Return to your homes, and smother this rebellion
in the bud, else the penalty will be great.
There shall be no association banded against the
laws of his most gracious majesty! See to it
that your fellows disperse at once, and have a
care how you meet in opposition to our will!"</p>

<p>"I pray your excellency to read that which
we have brought at risk of our lives," Master
Howell said firmly. "You will see that we do
not rebel against his majesty's laws; but rather
against those who exceed them unlawfully."</p>

<p>"Go home and pay your taxes, or I will sweep
the upper Carolina with my troops till it is a
wilderness!" the governor cried as if beside
himself with rage, and it appeared to me that
he was about to give yet more rein to his passion
when an officer entered hurriedly, whispering
a few words in the angry man's ear.</p>

<p>"Admit him at once," was the command, and
then, to my astonishment and fear, in walked
one of those two cavaliers who had opposed our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
passage and afterward made prisoners of the
deputies.</p>

<p>The newcomer had all the appearance of one
who has traveled far and fast, and after looking
around hurriedly as if to satisfy himself that we
were really there, he laid a paper on the table in
front of the governor.</p>

<p>Then, at a sign from Tryon, he backed out of
the room as if in the presence of royalty itself,
and the governor hastily took up the written
message.</p>

<p>It must have contained something which did
not please him, for his brows wrinkled as he
read, and after coming to the end he perused it
once more with greatest care.</p>

<p>Although having had no experience in such
matters, I understood full well that this missive
had been sent by David Edwards, and could
reason out all the circumstances readily.</p>

<p>Most likely a messenger had been sent back
to Hillsborough within a very short time after
the escape of the deputies, and even while a
portion of the party were pursuing us. Knowing
as he did, that the Regulation was sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
strong to dominate upper Carolina if it
was forced to extremities, Master Edwards had
unquestionably sent a full account of all that
had happened to the governor, in order that the
latter might not do anything rashly.</p>

<p>That my reasoning was correct I understood
when, after some reflection, Tryon, turned toward
us once more with something like a smile
of friendliness on his cruel face.</p>

<p>"You will excuse me, gentlemen, for having
diverted my attention even momentarily from
your affair. In these times, when treason is
rearing its head against his most gracious majesty
a moment's delay may have fatal results. I will
read your petition."</p>

<p>Then, as if he had but just understood our
request, he perused the document we brought,
and having done so said condescendingly:</p>

<p>"This matter shall receive our immediate
attention. Return to your homes; explain to
your associates that their welfare has my best
care, and assure them that within a month I will
make a personal visit to Hillsborough. Then
these complaints shall be inquired into by impartial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
judges, and that which is wrong or unjust
will be remedied without loss of time."</p>

<p>He bowed, to intimate that the audience was
at an end, and we went out of the room, not
backward, as had the messenger from Edwards;
but as gentlemen should, in a manner calculated
to show that we stood on terms of equality with
all there.</p>

<p>But for the manner in which he first received
us, I would have said that the troubles of our
people were well-nigh at an end; but, believing
he had spoken us fairly at the last only because
of realizing that the Regulation was of great
strength, I fancied we had accomplished nothing
of good by our coming.</p>

<p>When we were at the inn once more, and
could hold converse without fear of eavesdroppers,
I learned that the deputies were of
much my way of thinking, for Master Howell
said with a grim laugh:</p>

<p>"At least, we have pinned Tryon down to
the promise that he will come to Hillsborough
within a month."</p>

<p>"And then I warrant you that those whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
names are on the rolls of the associations will
find themselves fast beset by Fanning's henchmen.
Our last condition will be worse than
the first."</p>

<p>"He will need to bring a strong following
with him."</p>

<p>"Not so, my friend," Master Hunter replied
gravely. "The weak-kneed among us will
profess to believe in his promises, and the Regulation
will be reduced to less than an hundred.
He may work his will until again are the
people so oppressed that alleged rebellion becomes
necessary if we would save ourselves from
prison."</p>

<p>It was not a cheerful ending to our long journey;
but there was nothing more that we could
do, save make the people of Brunswick understand
yet more thoroughly the situation of affairs
in those countries where Fanning and Frohock
held the courts of law in their hands.</p>

<p>During the remainder of this day, in accordance
with Master Howell's suggestion, we
talked with such of the citizens as came to
question us, and by nightfall the Brunswickers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
must have had a fairly good idea of the situation
in upper Carolina, where already had four
hundred gentlemen declared they would resist
the misrule which was crushing them to the
earth.</p>

<p>One more day we spent in the town, and
then it was as if the citizens had learned all
they wished concerning our affairs, for our questioners
ceased to be curious, and Master Hunter
declared that the time had come when we
should return.</p>

<p>"We will set out to-morrow morning," he
said, and Master Howell nodded to show that
he was of the same mind. "Having described
to the association our journey, and that which
has taken place here, there will be nothing to
do until the governor institutes the promised
inquiry into the wrongs of the people."</p>

<p>"Which will result in yet greater oppression,"
Master Howell added moodily.</p>

<p>"We at least have done our duty, and will
again be in the front ranks of the association
when the time is ripe for action."</p>

<p>Well, all was done as Master Hunter had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
said. We were on the return journey shortly
after sunrise, and allowed the horses to take that
pace which best pleased them, for we had no
need to make great speed.</p>

<p>Our haversacks had been well filled at the
inn, and we would have no need of searching
for game until two days had passed, when it
was reasonable to suppose we should be in that
section of the country where the planters would
provide us with food and shelter.</p>

<p>There was no thought in our minds that any
effort would be made to stop us, for now were
we carrying a message from the governor, and
such an one as would go far toward soothing
our neighbors who had so lately been in arms
against those who represented the government.</p>

<p>At noon we halted an hour to rest the
animals, who were yet quite fresh for the journey,
and to partake of the noonday meal. Then
we rode leisurely forward again until about five
o'clock in the afternoon, when we were arrived
at a plantation where was promise of comfortable
accommodations for the night.</p>

<p>"It is better to halt here, at the expense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
two or three hours, rather than push on and
sleep in the open air," Master Howell said as
he reined his horse in at the door of the dwelling.</p>

<p>A white man and a negro, one an indentured
servant and the other a slave as we afterward
learned, appeared in response to our summons,
and from them we learned that the planter and
his family were in Newbern on a visit to relatives;
but this did not prevent us from receiving
such hospitality as is famous in the Carolinas.</p>

<p>The negro led our horses to a stable of logs
which was situated fifty feet or more in the
rear of the main buildings, and the white servant
ushered us into a sitting-room that gave access
to the broad, vine-covered veranda overlooking
the main road.</p>

<p>In this last place we were served with light
refreshments until a hearty meal could be
prepared, and my comrade and I congratulated
ourselves on having come across such a lodging,
when we had expected to sleep in the thicket
where flies and mosquitoes would disturb our
repose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>Our weapons, saddle-bags and haversacks
had been brought into the sitting-room, and we
could come at our belongings, if we so desired,
by simply stepping through the open window.</p>

<p>The deputies were taking their ease in a
couple of hammocks, and we two lads were
lounging in huge chairs when the clatter of
horses' hoofs aroused us all to curiosity.</p>

<p>Peering out through the vines which formed
a curtain in front of the veranda, I saw five
horsemen, the leader that same man who had
brought the message to the governor while we
were having audience, ride past in hot haste
and halt a few yards beyond the path leading
to the house as they carefully scanned the road.</p>

<p>"Yonder men have been following on our
trail," I said, giving words to the thought
which was caused by their movements. "Having
over-ridden it, they will turn back."</p>

<p>It was as I said.</p>

<p>The horsemen rode slowly back to the house-path,
gazed toward the building, and continued
on at a walk in the direction from which they
had come.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>"Can it be that Tryon would try to prevent
us from reaching Hillsborough?" Master
Hunter said half to himself, and Master Howell
replied grimly:</p>

<p>"Those fellows have followed us by his orders,
or those of Fanning and Edwards, you may be
certain, for they have no personal quarrel with
us. It is now known where we are, and I'm of
the opinion that we had best make preparations
for defense."</p>

<p>"But it is to the interest of the governor that
we report to the association his reply to our
petition," Master Hunter continued with the air
of one trying to read a riddle.</p>

<p>"So it seems to us who are not in the secret.
We need not try to solve the problem until
preparations for defense have been made, since
it is positive those fellows are on our trail."</p>

<p>I failed to understand how we might turn
another's house into our castle; but Master
Howell was not troubled by such trifles.</p>

<p>Entering the sitting-room hurriedly, he summoned
the white servant who was supposed to
be making ready a meal for us, and hurriedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
explained to him the situation, concluding by
saying:</p>

<p>"It is likely that we shall be attacked before
morning. What would your master do if he
were at home?"</p>

<p>The fellow shook his head in perplexity, and
Master Howell added:</p>

<p>"Having given us shelter we are his guests,
and as such he would be bound to aid us, provided
we had proven ourselves honest citizens of
Carolina. So much, and no more, you shall do.
I am of the opinion that they will take away the
horses, if possible, and to check such an attempt
the animals must be brought nearer the house
where we can defend them."</p>

<p>"There is no other stable, sir."</p>

<p>"Is there not a store-room where we can stable
them for the night? You can cleanse it to-morrow
morning with this to lighten the task,"
and Master Howell held out three silver coins.</p>

<p>The servant clutched the money eagerly as
he said:</p>

<p>"Peter the negro, and myself, are the only
servants on the plantation. The horses might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
be brought into the room which is used as a
kitchen during the winter. There is no floor,
and a few armfuls of straw would make them
comfortable."</p>

<p>"These lads shall assist you in caring for them
at once, and look to it that the saddles and
bridles are also brought into the house. Do
all you can to aid us, and double that amount
of silver shall be yours when we ride away."</p>

<p>It is easier to bribe an indentured servant than
a slave, because the former may be able to purchase
his freedom, and this fellow showed every
desire to aid us.</p>

<p>Sidney and I followed him to the rear of the
building while Masters Howell and Hunter remained
on the veranda with their rifles in hand,
and in a few seconds the negro was made to
understand what we would do. He brought
straw while we led the animals into the house,
and when so much had been accomplished the
servants and us lads brought a supply of water
from the well, filling every convenient vessel,
for there was in my mind the thought that we
might be called upon to stand a siege.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>When we had done this much, and we spent
not less than half an hour in the work, Sidney
and I went through the house to the veranda
where we found the deputies on guard.</p>

<p>I reported as to the arrangements we had
made, and Master Howell said approvingly:</p>

<p>"It is well. We are now prepared to give
those gentleman a warm reception, unless they
have some means which we have overlooked of
getting into the house. You lads are to stand
guard at the rear of the building, and if a
stranger appears, call upon him to halt; if he
then advances you will be warranted in shooting.
In case the governor thinks to make way
with us he will find that he has undertaken
quite a task."</p>

<p>"By calling out the soldiers he could soon put
an end to our return," Sidney suggested.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what he won't do, especially
after we have made our story so public in
Brunswick. It is not in Tryon's nature to come
out like a gentleman in his usurpation of authority;
but he must needs scheme to carry his ends
by trickery. If he can dispose of us through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
agency of these fellows, well and good, for there
is little chance he can be connected with the
crime. Have no fear that any public movement
will be made to deprive us of freedom
or life."</p>

<p>We lads took our rifles and went to the back
porch, where we were screened by the vines, and
while the white servant prepared supper and the
black acted as assistant, we watched for the
enemy, feeling ill at ease, as well we might.</p>

<p>After having come to believe that our troubles
were at an end with the delivery of the petition,
I was particularly cast down at thus learning
that our enemies were inclined to pursue us yet
further. It had an ugly look, as if Fanning and
Edwards, with the possible consent of the governor,
were seeking to take our lives, although,
study the matter as I would, it was beyond my
poor powers to make out how the rule of the
king in the Carolinas would be strengthened by
our death.</p>

<p>It seemed more as if the discontent round
about Hillsborough would be increased in case
we were slain, and that the Regulators would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
make every effort to avenge the murder of their
deputies.</p>

<p>It was all a riddle to me, and after turning
the matter over and over again in my mind, I
asked Sidney what he made of it.</p>

<p>"Nothing whatsoever," he replied with a long-drawn
breath. "I cannot solve the riddle; but
this much is certain, that those fellows who followed
our trail to this house are the same who
made prisoners of Masters Howell and Hunter,
and unless we are willing to go to prison somewhere
between here and Hillsborough, we stand
a good chance of being shot."</p>

<p>"Why do you say 'somewhere between here
and Hillsborough'?" I asked in perplexity.</p>

<p>"Because if we are not murdered outright, it
will be to Tryon's interest to keep us well hidden
from the Regulators, who would use every effort
to free us, and we could not be imprisoned secretly
either at Brunswick or Hillsborough."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="s08">BESIEGED.</span></h2>

<p>While we lads crouched amid the vines which
covered the porch of the dwelling wherein we
had entrenched ourselves without due authority
from the owner, watching intently for some token
that our enemies were creeping up on us, the
question came into my mind as to whether a
goodly portion of the present trouble did not
come from the fact that Master James Hunter
was one of the deputies appointed by the association.</p>

<p>Then there came back to me all I had heard
regarding the arrest of Masters Husband and
William Hunter, a cousin of Deputy Hunter.
It was said by some that Fanning had particular
reasons for desiring the imprisonment of James,
while he did not have a speaking acquaintance
with William.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>When the arrest was made, or rather when
the two Regulators were taken into custody to
convenience Messrs. Fanning and Edwards, the
wrong Hunter was taken, and he against whom
the attorney had been working was appointed
one of two to represent the Regulation at an interview
with the governor.</p>

<p>It was a vile act, throwing two men into jail
on a charge of seditious conduct, simply to pleasure
a couple of villains; but even this was not
the worst of our treatment at the hands of Governor
Tryon and his minions.</p>

<p>I could fill an hundred pages like this with
accounts of injustice done us of the Carolinas,
and yet set nothing down which might not be
verified by reliable witnesses, while every item
would be the record of an outrage as gross as
that committed in the imprisonment of Masters
Husband and Hunter.</p>

<p>If it could have been known throughout all
the colonies what we of the Carolinas suffered
under the misrule of William Tryon, then would
that declaration of liberty which was made in
1776, have been brought about five years earlier.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>However, it is not for me to hark back to
the beginning of our troubles; I have set down
these thoughts because they came into my mind
like a flood while Sidney Hubbard and I remained
on the alert against those who, unquestionably,
had been instigated by men whose duty
it was to protect the people, instead of riding
them down like foxes on the hunting field.</p>

<p>I had been disheartened by the sudden turn
in affairs, and the predictions made by Sidney,
until it was to me as if the efforts to assert our
rights as honest men would result in the death
or imprisonment of all concerned in the undertaking.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as I thus agitated myself about
affairs which would be regulated by Providence,
we two lads kept close watch but without seeing
or hearing anything of those horsemen, who,
as we knew full well, were lurking near at hand
to work us some mischief.</p>

<p>When the white servant had prepared our
supper, Masters Howell and Sidney went inside
the dwelling to partake of the meal, leaving
Master Hunter and me on guard, and, later, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
two were relieved by the others to take our
places at the table.</p>

<p>While Master James Hunter and I were eating,
I ventured to ask him what he thought of
the situation, and received as reply:</p>

<p>"We are better off here than on the road, although
it seems likely our return will be greatly
delayed."</p>

<p>"Meaning that you believe those men whom
we saw will spend much time trying to capture
us?"</p>

<p>"We shall not be able to continue our journey
save at the expense of an encounter with those
villains, and whether we ever see home again
depends, as I believe, upon our being the best
marksmen."</p>

<p>Such a prediction did not tend to raise my
spirits, as can well be imagined, and straightway
all desire for food fled from me.</p>

<p>I left the table without ceremony, and rejoined
Sidney, full of determination to shoot
with true aim if one of our enemies would present
himself as a target.</p>

<p>Until the sun had gone down we watched in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
vain, and while the twilight was gathering
Master Howell announced his intention of venturing
out to reconnoiter, for it seemed necessary
we should know what disposition had been
made of their forces.</p>

<p>Sidney insisted that he or I should be allowed
to perform such task, arguing with great force,
so I thought, that it would be of but little consequence
if one of us lads was captured,
while it could not be reckoned anything
short of a disaster if harm befell either of the
deputies.</p>

<p>Master Howell turned a deaf ear to his arguments
and entreaties, replying again and again
that he would not put a dangerous duty upon
a boy when he was able to perform the task
himself.</p>

<p>Even while we strove to restrain him, he went
out into the night, as if bent on visiting the
stable, and when he had arrived at that building
it was no longer possible for us to distinguish
his form.</p>

<p>Master Hunter kept watch alone at the front
of the house, and in the rear Sidney and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
strained our ears for some token of disaster or
success.</p>

<p>The deputy had been absent a full half hour,
during which time we heard nothing save the
movements of the servants, or the stamping of
the horses in the winter kitchen, and then suddenly,
as if he had risen from the ground, appeared
Master Howell.</p>

<p>We lads raised our rifles, not knowing for the
instant whether it was friend or foe who had
come upon us so silently, and then we heard his
voice:</p>

<p>"I have returned; do not fire."</p>

<p>He stood on the porch an instant to tell us in
whispers the result of his investigations.</p>

<p>"They have surrounded the buildings in such
manner that we cannot leave secretly, and appear
to be content with that. As I look at the
matter, they, having trapped us, are waiting for
reinforcements, or, possibly, officers of the law."</p>

<p>"But you have said that Governor Tryon
does not dare to cause our arrest now that the
people of Brunswick have heard all the story,"
I suggested, not a little alarmed by the information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
that the enemy appeared well content
to wait until we might be captured with greater
ease.</p>

<p>"It was my proposition that Tryon would
not dare arrest us in Brunswick; but now we
have left that place, he might work his will
without the people being any the wiser."</p>

<p>There was in Master Howell's tone that which
convinced me he was seriously disturbed by
the condition of affairs, and I understood such
was really the case when he added:</p>

<p>"I think it is high time we held a conference
of war, and one of you lads had best come with
me to the front veranda, while the other remains
here on guard."</p>

<p>I motioned Sidney to accompany Master
Howell, and he, eager to hear all which might
be said, readily acceded to the mute suggestion.</p>

<p>In another moment I was alone, peering out
into the darkness with every faculty on the
alert, and thus I remained until half an hour or
more had passed, when my comrade returned.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked impatiently, burning to
learn the result of the conference, for I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
worked myself into a fever, trying to imagine
what else we might do save await the preparations
of our enemies.</p>

<p>"It is decided that we leave this place about
midnight," he said in a cautious whisper; "that
is, if you agree to the proposition."</p>

<p>"If I agree!" I repeated in nervous petulance.
"What can I have to do with any plan
which may be proposed?"</p>

<p>"If we set out it will be at risk of our lives,
and the deputies have decided that no move
shall be made unless all four of us are fully
agreed that nothing different can be done."</p>

<p>"But how may we go or come at our pleasure
if the house is surrounded?"</p>

<p>"We can saddle the horses, and mount while
yet in the building. Then it is a case of starting
with a rush, hoping that in the darkness
those fellows will not be able to shoot us down."</p>

<p>"We are to run away, then?" I asked in surprise,
for it had been in my mind that both
Master Howell and Master Hunter would insist
on fighting, however great the odds.</p>

<p>"It seems necessary to do so if we would see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
our friends again, and the deputies believe it is
of the utmost importance the Regulation be
acquainted with the fact that all manner of
treachery will be brought to bear, rather than
do us justice. Therefore we will run instead
of fight. Our horses are as fresh as theirs, and
we may be able to give them the slip. In case
we are brought to bay, it is better, so the gentlemen
have decided, that we stand opposed to
five or six men, rather than a large body. Are
you agreed?"</p>

<p>"It is useless to ask such a question. I shall
do whatsoever the deputies think best."</p>

<p>"Then, if that be your mind, the time may
come when you will be called upon to act what
appears to me like a cowardly part."</p>

<p>I was amazed by this remark, and it can be
readily supposed that I insisted upon an immediate
explanation.</p>

<p>"The deputies are agreed that in case we are
brought to a standstill, you and I are to make
our way to Maddock's Mill without regard to
them. They will fight, whatsoever the odds, for
the sole purpose of allowing us to escape."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>"Why have they grown so careful of us?" I
cried, never dreaming of that which would
have come instantly into the mind of a quicker-witted
lad.</p>

<p>"It is that we may carry the news to our
friends. Masters Howell and Hunter will sacrifice
their lives in order that the members of the
association may be informed of the exact situation
of affairs."</p>

<p>I made no promises; timorous though I was,
there could be, so I said to myself, no time
when I would feel warranted in leaving comrades
or companions struggling against a superior
force. The Regulation might forever remain
in ignorance of what had been said at Brunswick,
before I would write myself down such
a coward as to seek safety while others of
my party were in peril.</p>

<p>Luckily Sidney did not exact a promise from
me on this score, and when Master Howell came
to where we stood, he believed I had fully agreed
to all the propositions.</p>

<p>"Sidney and I will saddle the horses when
the time comes, and you and Hunter will only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
leave your posts in order to mount and make
the rush. There is opportunity for us to gain
a couple of hours' sleep. I will stand guard in
front, Sidney is to remain here, and in due time
you and Hunter shall act as sentinels."</p>

<p>I was not disposed for slumber; but this was
virtually a command, and without hesitation I
went into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>Here I soon fell asleep, despite the fear in
my heart, and when Master Howell aroused me,
at the expiration of two hours, it was as if I had
but just closed my eyes.</p>

<p>Then I performed the part of sentinel,
when the hours seemed as long as the time
of repose had been short, and it was as if the
night had passed before Master Hunter came
to announce that the moment for action had
arrived.</p>

<p>Then he went back, leaving me with the blood
bounding through my veins, and my heart throbbing
violently, for I believed that one or more of
us would soon be in another world.</p>

<p>As had been agreed upon, Master Howell and
Sidney made ready the horses, and the words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
were passed to the front veranda that that post
be vacated.</p>

<p>Now we moved swiftly, mounting the horses
while they were within the makeshift of a stable,
and when all were in the saddle Master Howell
paused to say:</p>

<p>"I will lead the way, then comes Clare, Sidney,
and lastly Hunter. Ride in close order,
and at full speed."</p>

<p>The indentured servant stood near the door,
yet holding the money which had been paid
him according to promise, and our leader rode
out into the darkness.</p>

<p>At a foot pace we went around the building,
until coming to the path leading into the road,
when Master Howell struck the spurs deep, his
horse darting off like an arrow sent from a bow.</p>

<p>At that same instant came the crack of a
rifle; I heard the ball whistling a few inches
above my head, and said to myself that if the
enemy shot as well as that in the beginning, they
must succeed in winging all of us before we were
well under way.</p>

<p>The fever of excitement was so great upon me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
that I cannot well say exactly what happened
during five minutes after we emerged from the
stable.</p>

<p>I only know that a volley of musketry rang
out; that I fired point-blank at a man who suddenly
appeared from out a clump of bushes, and
cheered when he fell. Then it was as if a
fierce conflict was being waged all around us,
and that we rode through the showers of bullets
until gaining the main road, when our animals
stretched themselves to the race.</p>

<p>I came out from the dream into which I had
been plunged, when Master Howell shouted to
know who had been hurt, and each in turn
declared that he was not even scratched.</p>

<p>It seemed almost impossible we could have
come through that shower of bullets without
being riddled, yet such was the case, and then
I wondered whether the horses had fared as
well.</p>

<p>My steed was going true; I could feel the
play of his muscles beneath me, and knew beyond
a peradventure that he like myself was yet
sound in wind and limb.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>"They aimed too high!" Master Howell cried
exultantly. "If the scoundrels had turned their
attention to crippling the animals, our chances
would have been slim. Huzza for the Regulation!"</p>

<p>Then we four who had ridden out from the
shadow of death gave voice to our triumph, and
from the rear came a yell of rage, telling us that
it yet remained to shake off the pursuers who
were bent on taking us, dead or alive.</p>

<p>"Keep your horses well in hand," Master
Hunter cried. "There's a long race ahead of us,
and we must not wind the beasts."</p>

<p>Our leader set the pace, riding only to keep
beyond rifle range, and we four came alongside
each other until we filled the road so completely
that had any unfortunate been ahead on foot we
must have trampled him down.</p>

<p>It was possible now to converse, and I fancied
also that the animals traveled more easily by thus
being in company.</p>

<p>When an hour had passed and we were come
to a stream, the deputies and I dismounted, standing
side by side in the road, while Sidney gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
the horses water enough to wet their throats, and
loosened the girths that they might regain their
wind, for all four were well nigh blown.</p>

<p>We there stood ready to fire in case the
pursuers came up before the steeds were ready
for the road again, and word had been passed
that we should give our attention to crippling
the enemy's horses rather than the men.</p>

<p>During fifteen minutes did we remain with
rifles in hand ready to be drawn to the shoulder
at the first show of a pursuer, and then the
chase was resumed.</p>

<p>We had gained a long start of Governor
Tryon's minions; but the halt would enable
him to cut down the advantage, and again we
rode at racing speed until once more it became
necessary to halt.</p>

<p>In this manner was the night spent; we favoring
the faithful animals as much as possible, and
while they rested, standing shoulder to shoulder
ready for a battle.</p>

<p>When morning dawned we could see no signs
of the enemy in the road, and this fact troubled
me not a little, because I feared that they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
taken a short cut unknown to us, and we would
soon find them in advance to check our
flight.</p>

<p>By riding until nearly noon we arrived at the
plantation of William Payne, on whom Master
Howell could rely fully, and here we came
to a halt, counting to give the horses a long
rest.</p>

<p>Our host had two sons, and with such an
accession to our numbers we were not greatly
dismayed by the prospect of another siege, therefore
we dismounted, and my timorousness vanished
as I realized that we were now so far
from Brunswick there was little fear but that
word could be sent to the members of the association
even though we should be disabled.</p>

<p>While we ate dinner, which had been hurriedly
prepared, and the sons of our host cared for our
leg-weary steeds, Master Howell told all the
story of our adventures, and the owner of the
plantation proposed that one of his boys take a
fresh horse for the purpose of making his way
to Maddock's Mill with the tidings.</p>

<p>After some little discussion our deputies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
agreed to this proposition, and before we
stretched ourselves out to sleep the lad rode
away, counting to change horses at the house of
a friend, forty miles distant.</p>

<p>Our mission was thus virtually accomplished,
and we composed ourselves for slumber with
the satisfaction of knowing that the duty due
the association was the same as performed.</p>

<p>Our host and his son agreed to stand watch
while we slept, and nothing disturbed us until
well into the night, when I was aroused by
hearing the owner of the plantation as he entered
the room to awaken the deputies. Then I overheard
the following conversation:</p>

<p>"Your pursuers are here. The hoof-prints of
your horses could be plainly seen on the lane,
and all hands were in front of the house before
seeming to realize the situation."</p>

<p>"Where are they now?" Master Howell
asked quietly as he arose with difficulty from
the bed, for his joints were stiff and lame after
the hard race.</p>

<p>"I forbade their coming nearer, and warned
the party to leave my premises. They asked if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
two men and two lads were here, and I, fearing
lest they might pursue my son, told them the
truth."</p>

<p>"That was well done," Master Howell replied
approvingly. "Now they may besiege
us once more, and we will make no effort
to get away unless, perchance, you object to
our resisting the governor's servants from your
house."</p>

<p>"Do as you will with me and mine. My
wrongs are not less than yours, and now is the
time when we of the Carolinas must prove ourselves
men, or expect to remain under the yoke
forever."</p>

<p>"You may be set down as a traitor to the
king if we make this house our castle," Master
Hunter suggested; but stout Master William
Payne was not to be frightened.</p>

<p>"I can't say that I have any quarrel with the
king himself; but against his representatives
in the Carolinas my hand shall never be lowered.
I aroused you only that you may be prepared
in case an attack is made."</p>

<p>"We will let the boys sleep, while Hunter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
and I have a look around," our deputy said in a
low voice, and the three men left the room softly,
believing we lads were yet asleep.</p>

<p>When they were gone Sidney said as he turned
to face me, for we had been sleeping in the
same bed:</p>

<p>"So it seems that we are besieged again."</p>

<p>"Did you hear all Master Payne said?"</p>

<p>"Every word."</p>

<p>"We are like to make quite a halt here."</p>

<p>"And can well afford to do so, now that word
has been sent on ahead. Young Payne will
readily arrive at Maddock's Mill by to-morrow
afternoon, if he gets a fresh horse during the
night, and we shall soon have reinforcements
enough to settle as many as have come."</p>

<p>"If we must fight to get back home, what
will be the result once we arrive there?" I
asked, a new fear coming over me.</p>

<p>"That is something concerning which we
need not trouble ourselves for the present,"
Sidney replied carelessly.</p>

<p>"Then I'm of the mind that Fanning will
speedily find a chance to clap us into jail on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
charge of treason, unless the association holds
together to the bitter end."</p>

<p>Such mournful conversation might have been
continued a long while but for the fact that it
was interrupted by a volley of musketry, succeeded
by straggling shots which told that our
people were replying only when they saw a
target.</p>

<p>"It's to be a battle instead of a siege!" Sidney
cried as he hurriedly dressed himself, I following
his example; but the firing had ceased by
the time we gained the kitchen, which apartment
was directly below our chamber.</p>

<p>Here we found Master Howell and our host,
one at the door and another peering out of a
loophole cut in the shutters of a window, and I
knew full well that Master Hunter and young
Payne were on guard at the front of the building.</p>

<p>"Where can we be of service, sir?" I asked,
and Master Payne replied with a grim laugh:</p>

<p>"I reckon you lads will not be needed, save,
perhaps, to stand guard later. The gentlemen
from Brunswick fired in order to learn if we
were prepared to receive them, and I'll answer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
for it that at least one knows to his cost that
we're not to be caught napping."</p>

<p>"How many do they number?" Sidney
asked, and Master Howell said gravely:</p>

<p>"Not less than a dozen. The reinforcements
have evidently responded to the summons sent
from our last halting place."</p>

<p>"We should be able to hold our own until
some of the Regulators arrive?"</p>

<p>"Aye, lad, and that is causing me no little
uneasiness. By protecting ourselves we shall
be giving Tryon an excuse for breaking his
word, and before this business comes to an end
the upper Carolina will be overrun by the
king's soldiers. It is beginning to be rebellion
in good earnest!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="s08">TIMELY AID.</span></h2>

<p>It appeared to me that Master Howell was
trying to "lock his stable door after the horse
had been stolen," when he mourned the fact that
what we were doing in our own defense might
be taken as open rebellion.</p>

<p>To my mind the people had rebelled openly
and with emphasis when the Regulators rode,
four hundred strong, to release Masters Husband
and Hunter.</p>

<p>We four who had visited Brunswick to lay before
the governor a petition couched in most respectful
language, could not be accused of aiding
and abetting rebellion when we objected to being
shot down or taken prisoners by strangers
who had no lawful warrant to deprive honest
citizens of their lives or liberty.</p>

<p>As the matter presented itself to my view,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
those on the outside were the ones who acted in
a rebellious manner, and there was no honest
judge in the country who would not rule that
we had every right to protect ourselves.</p>

<p>Something of this kind I said to Master Howell
when he appeared to be bowed down with grief
because, as he declared, our people were making
a show of what might be called treason, and to
my great surprise I found that we who were
fighting our way from Brunswick to Hillsborough
did not have any place in what it might
please the governor to term "open rebellion."</p>

<p>"We four are of no consequence in the outcome
of this matter," Master Howell said, condescending
to explain to me the situation as it
appeared to him, "and yet through us, or, rather,
through our distress, will the king's officers most
likely declare the upper Carolina under military
rule. If we could continue our journey to Maddock's
Mill without interruption, all would be
well. Or, if we fought for our lives from this
moment until we were killed or come to our
journey's end, it would also be of no moment.
That which distresses me is, that young Payne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
will give the Regulators an account of our troubles,
and those gentlemen will ride in full force
to aid us. Then has come the time for Governor
Tryon's minions to declare that the colony
is in revolt, and the fact that four hundred armed
men have banded together to regulate affairs
outside their own country is fair proof that the
cry of treason has good foundation."</p>

<p>"Well, and what then?" I made bold to say.</p>

<p>"Then will the king's troops be sent to Hillsborough
and the surrounding towns. Fanning
and Edwards can work their will on the people,
with an armed force at their backs, and when
the Regulators oppose the military it will be
represented that the whole colony is in revolt."</p>

<p>"That was much the condition of affairs when
we left Maddock's Mill," I ventured to suggest.</p>

<p>"Aye, lad; but then we had not opposed ourselves
to the king's forces. Now it will be necessary
to begin what can be called by no other
name than that of treason."</p>

<p>"It alarms you that such should be the
case, Master Howell?" I said in a questioning
tone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>"Not for myself, lad, not for myself, nor for
any of us who are brought to a stand in this
house. It is the women and small children of
whom I am thinking. We can fight to the bitter
end; but they will suffer an hundred deaths while
the English soldiers overrun the colony."</p>

<p>"Then would it have been better had we surrendered
when we were first besieged."</p>

<p>It was as if this remark stimulated the deputy.
His eyes brightened, he straightened himself suddenly,
and said as if speaking to a vast assembly,
instead of one timorous lad:</p>

<p>"Not so, Clare. I was but considering the
sufferings of our own people, and that should
not be reckoned as against the grand result.
This is indeed open rebellion, and the news of
our oppression will flash from province to province
until the entire country is aroused. Then,
perhaps not until after we are dead, but at some
time in the near future, will the rule of the king
come to an end in America. We are the instruments
selected to begin the way for freedom,
and in future ages we will be spoken of as those
who brought into existence a free country which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
shall be as a beacon light to those who are ground
beneath the heel of selfish kings!"</p>

<p>From, that instant it was as if Master Howell's
entire nature had changed. He appeared to be
exulting in the danger which surrounded us,
and was eager for the fray.</p>

<p>We stood watch until daylight, and then it
was possible to see that Master Payne's dwelling
was surrounded by fifteen or twenty men, some
wearing uniforms, and others clad only in the
garb of planters.</p>

<p>The fact of there being soldiers among our
besiegers told plainly that Tryon himself
planned the outrage, and when such was apparent
I heard Master Hunter say in a low tone to
Master Howell:</p>

<p>"From this day the Regulation will remain
under arms until all the colonies are prepared
to take up the struggle against the king's minions!
Instead of 'Regulators' we should call
ourselves 'Sons of Liberty.'"</p>

<p>And thus it was that the association known
as Sons of Liberty sprang into existence at the
home of a planter in the Carolinas&mdash;that association
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
which was speedily to extend throughout
all the colonies as far east as Massachusetts, and
south to the limits of the country.</p>

<p>As when we made the last stand, there was
no disposition on the part of the enemy to make
an attack. We had bettered our situation, and
increased the number of rebels, therefore
Tryon's minions probably believed it necessary
to strengthen their ranks.</p>

<p>During this day we remained on guard and
alert, while our enemies were posted just beyond
rifle range in such manner as to encircle
us completely.</p>

<p>By making a rush after dark, as had been
done before, we might readily have broken
through the thin line; in fact such a move was
suggested by Sidney, but Master Howell said
firmly as if he had finally committed his life and
fortune to that final result he foresaw:</p>

<p>"We will wait for the Regulators. Since
Tryon wishes to force us into open rebellion, he
shall be gratified. Shoot down yonder villains
if it so be you can; but here we remain until
overpowered, or rescued by those who will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
speedily come to avenge the wrongs which are
perpetrated upon all the colony."</p>

<p>We had no opportunity to open fire on the
enemy during the day; but when night came,
and they drew more closely the circle of guards,
we found a target now and then, thus reducing
the number until I believe of a verity we might
have ventured out and beat them off in a hand-to-hand
fight.</p>

<p>It is not well that I spend too many words
on the situation at the Payne plantation, for
the story is one of careful watch only, with now
and then the report of a rifle to tell that we
were on the alert. The enemy took turns at
using us for targets; but, sheltered as we were
behind the walls, they did no injury, while I
am confident we disabled not less than four
during the time of our arrival and noon of the
third day.</p>

<p>Then we saw a cloud of dust in the distance,
heard the shouts of horsemen, and soon saw a
body of gentlemen full four hundred strong ride
down like a whirlwind upon fugitives who had
lately been our besiegers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>We sallied forth, and before the fray was
come to an end our friends had seven prisoners.
None were killed outright so far as I could
learn; the remainder had taken the alarm in
time to seek safety by flight, and our road to
Maddock's Mill lay open before us.</p>

<p>Young Payne had discharged his mission
well; the Regulation was in session considering
an arrest which had been made for non-payment
of taxes, and, waiting only long enough
to secure a supply of provisions, had set off for
our relief.</p>

<p>The entire party camped on the plantation
that night, and before morning came, their
plans for the future were fully formed.</p>

<p>It was decided that the gentlemen composing
the Regulation should remain under arms
until Governor Tryon fulfilled his promise, or
ignored it altogether, and during this time of
waiting all efforts should be directed toward
protecting those who refused to pay the unjust
tax.</p>

<p>On this evening Sidney and I were regularly
admitted to the ranks of the Sons of Liberty, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
if we were indeed men in age, and so wrought
up was I by Master Howell's words, that I persuaded
myself the colonies would speedily be
freed from the rule of a master who had set over
us such men as Tryon, Edwards and Fanning.</p>

<p>We left Master Payne's plantation next morning
at sunrise, and in due time arrived at Maddock's
Mill, where it had been decided the Regulation
would have its headquarters.</p>

<p>It was no slight task to provide food and
shelter for such a number; but once it was
known that the governor evidently intended to
play fast and loose with the people of our section,
every one, including those who had not
deemed it right to join the Regulation, set about
bringing in stores of food for both men and
horses. Then the men began building shelters,
working in squads of five, three, or two, as was
mutually agreed upon, and soon the neighborhood
of Maddock's Mill resembled a military
encampment.</p>

<p>The rebellion began to assume decided form.</p>

<p>As may be fancied, Sidney and I were camp-mates.
We built for ourselves a lean-to which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
would shelter us from the rain at least, and in
the rear of it made an enclosure into which the
horses could be brought at night.</p>

<p>It was not believed safe for us to go home,
even for a few hours, because Edwards and
Fanning had men out in every direction picking
up a victim here and there, and we lads knew
full well that Sandy Wells would take full advantage
of the opportunity in case he came upon us
where we could not defend ourselves.</p>

<p>The Regulators were waiting to learn whether
Tryon would keep the word given to the deputies,
and a dull time of it we lads had meanwhile.</p>

<p>Since one day was passed much as another,
with nothing by way of excitement save when
news came of this or that high-handed proceeding
on the part of the secretary and the attorney,
I propose to set down here simply an account of
the general happenings in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The Regulators had scouts out in every direction,
and therefore it was we learned, early in
July, when we were heartily tired with lounging
around camp while it seemed necessary the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
active measures should be taken, that Governor
Tryon, with an escort of an hundred and sixty
soldiers, had arrived in Hillsborough.</p>

<p>This was in accordance with his promise, and
those who hoped the colony would not be forced
to resist the king's laws were filled with joy,
particularly when the governor issued a proclamation
declaring that he had come to right
the wrongs complained of in the petition delivered
to him at Brunswick.</p>

<p>Not a word in his official note to the people
was said regarding the Regulators; but the
citizens were requested to keep the peace until
such time as the several complaints could be
acted upon by the courts of law, and it was promised
that if they remained quiet all should
be done in accordance with the wishes of the
majority.</p>

<p>When this proclamation was sent out over the
colony there were many who urged that the
Regulation be dissolved, lest the fact of so many
armed men remaining together might be construed
by the governor as outright treason.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact an hundred or more did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
leave the encampment, returning to their homes,
and but for the earnest entreaties of General
Hamilton, the deputies, my father, and several
others, the Sons of Liberty would have dispersed
simply because Tryon and his crew wished it so.</p>

<p>Before one week had passed after the issuance
of the proclamation, it could readily be seen that
our burdens were to be increased instead of
lightened. Twenty or more of those who had
left the Regulation and returned home were
arrested for non-payment of the poll tax levied
to build Tryon's palace.</p>

<p>Edwards and Fanning no longer spoke of
pacifying, but of subduing, the people, and warrants
were sworn out daily for the purpose of
putting into prison those who were absolutely
unable to pay the amount demanded.</p>

<p>Fanning's fees were increased until they
amounted to ten times as much as the law allowed
for court services, and the poor wretch
with money or lands who fell into his hands was
unmercifully shorn of all his possessions before
being set free.</p>

<p>The wickedness was increased twenty-fold,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
and no man could say at what moment the
prison-doors might open to receive him, save
we who remained banded together in the encampment
at Maddock's Mill.</p>

<p>Then Governor Tryon proceeded to frighten
the wretched people by marching with his soldiers
from Hillsborough to Mecklenburg, and
there coaxing or scaring twenty or more timorous
souls to enlist in the army he said should
be raised to subdue "the rebellion in upper
Carolina."</p>

<p>Then he marched to Salisbury and back to
Hillsborough, enlisting recruits wherever men or
lads could be cajoled or frightened, and, with
an army of an hundred and sixty trained soldiers
and about fifty feeble-minded colonists, he proceeded
to play the part of king; but with rather
poor success.</p>

<p>By this time such of the Sons of Liberty as
had returned to their homes and were yet at
liberty came back to Maddock's Mill prepared
to remain until matters were of a different complexion,
and once more the defenders of the colony
presented a formidable front to the tyrant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>We numbered upwards of three hundred and
eighty, and by advice of General Hamilton our
camp was moved nearer Hillsborough in order
that we might protect the country roundabout.</p>

<p>In answer to what he was pleased to term a
"threat," on our part, Tryon called out the
militia of the colony, threatening direst vengeance
upon those who dare disregard the call.
By such means he added twenty or more to his
army, and once again were the sheriffs sent to
collect taxes, each officer guarded by a squad of
ten soldiers.</p>

<p>Now was come the time when the Regulation
believed something more should be done than
remaining idly in camp.</p>

<p>We were told off into squads of twenty-five,
and day after day we rode here or there as our
scouts reported the movements of the sheriff,
driving back the officials and their guards as if
they had been so many sheep.</p>

<p>When the guard of the tax-collectors were increased
in numbers, our detachments were added
to, and in every case we sent back the scurvy
rascals. Sometimes they plucked up courage to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
exchange shots with us, when we always managed
to disable one or more; but as a rule they
beat a hasty retreat whenever we came in sight.</p>

<p>We had orders not to shoot unless we were
attacked, and it was hard at times to obey, particularly
when, in the course of our forays,
Sidney and I saw Sandy Wells at the head of a
dozen soldiers destroying the household goods
of a widow with one son of seventeen, who
could not pay the money demanded.</p>

<p>Before the middle of August, however, we
made the governor and his crew understand
that we were masters of that section of country,
and instead of sending out sheriffs on fruitless
errands, Tryon set about strengthening his position
as if fearing we might attempt to capture
Hillsborough.</p>

<p>That town was a fortified camp, and none of
the royalists dared ride three miles in either
direction.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that neither Edwards,
Fanning, nor any member of the sheriff's posse
trusted himself outside the town. General
Hamilton had given orders that we were to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
capture any of Tryon's officers which we might
come across, and keen were all for such game.</p>

<p>I would willingly have given my horse and
rifle, all the property I owned, for the privilege
of bringing into camp as my prisoner the
attorney Fanning. Although we were under
strict orders not to shed blood, save in defense
of our own, I question if that black-hearted
lawyer's life would have been worth a moment's
purchase once he was in our power.</p>

<p>Among Tryon's many proclamations at this
time was one which stated that on the twenty-second
of September would be begun the trials
of those who were confined in jail for any offense,
and without question the case of Masters Husband
and William Hunter would then be called.
It also pleased the representative of the king to
declare that "since charges had been preferred
against Edmund Fanning, attorney, he would be
called upon to render an account of his doings."</p>

<p>No one among the Sons of Liberty believed
the wretch who had caused so much misery
would be regularly tried; but all were curious
to see how Tryon might save his minion when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
so many and such serious charges could, and
would, be made against him.</p>

<p>I have tried to set down here an outline of
what Sidney and I did during all that long
summer while we waited for the royal governor
to do us justice, which had been so long withheld.
And by telling it in the fewest possible words,
we are now come to three days before the time
set for the trials, or, in other words, to the
nineteenth of September, in the year of grace
1768.</p>

<p>The Sons of Liberty were resolved that there
should be ample evidence against Fanning,
whatever the cost, therefore from among the
members of the association eight were selected
who could swear truthfully that the attorney
had defrauded them of several considerable sums
of money.</p>

<p>It was believed that, unless protected in some
manner, these witnesses would be arrested immediately
they showed themselves in Hillsborough,
therefore the officers of the Regulation
prepared a paper stating that in case these men,
whose names were set down therein, should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
be interfered with in any manner while they
were in town to serve as witnesses, the Regulators
would immediately make an assault.
It was further stated that the lives of the governor
and his associates depended entirely upon
the manner in which our people were treated,
for it would be the duty of every Son of Liberty
to seek out the principal officials during the
assault, for the purpose of shooting them down.</p>

<p>This was open rebellion, and no mistake; but
in order to prevent Tryon from declaring that we
had intimidated the courts of justice, there was
added to the document the agreement that no
member of the association would interfere in
any manner whatsoever with the judges or the
officials of the court, while the cases were being
conducted in a way agreeably with the laws of
the king.</p>

<p>This document was sent to the governor by
one of our scouts who, going into town, secretly
gave it to a royalist for transmission, and, before
it could be delivered the venturesome man had
rejoined us.</p>

<p>Nor was this all the association did in order to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
secure fair and impartial trials for Fanning as
well our friends.</p>

<p>It was decided by the association in council,
that while we remained at such a distance from
Hillsborough Tryon might take upon himself
the risk of conducting matters without regard
to our just demands; therefore the camp was
moved once more, and this time to a small hill
overlooking the town, and hardly more than half
a mile from the court-house.</p>

<p>Here we felled trees to serve as breastworks,
and otherwise guarded against an attack, for many
of us believed that as soon as the Sons of Liberty
showed themselves, the so-called king's forces
would make a desperate attack, alleging as the
reason therefor that they were in fear we might
attempt to take possession of the town.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the twentieth of
September when we rode up the hill in full view
of Governor Tryon's forces; but no demonstration
was made against us. The people could see
that we were preparing to resist an attack;
but they remained as if paralyzed with astonishment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>Near nightfall came a mounted soldier bearing
a white flag, who demanded in the governor's
name the reason for our display of force, and
General Hamilton replied to the question.</p>

<p>"This is no display of force," he said. "We
have come as citizens of upper Carolina to safeguard
several witnesses, and have no mind to
interfere in any way with the proceedings. Say
to Governor Tryon that we shall remain until
the close of the session, and that never a man of
us will ride into town while the people are given
the rights accorded to them by the king and
parliament. If, however, there should be an
attempt to deprive a witness of his liberty, we
shall ride down like a whirlwind, carrying out
to the utmost the plan which we have already
had the honor to submit to the governor."</p>

<p>The man rode back, and before night came we
could see that Tryon's residence was guarded by
three-score men, a fact which caused Master
Howell to say scornfully:</p>

<p>"I wonder if the coward thinks to save himself
from our vengeance, with sixty recruits?
We will overturn them, if there be any act of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
treachery, before William Tryon can sign his
name!"</p>

<p>After that we waited in anxious suspense, but
constantly on the alert, for the day when law
and order would be established in upper
Carolina, or it might be known beyond a peradventure
that we must depend upon ourselves
entirely for liberty and the opportunity to live
upon our own lands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="s08">SANDY WELLS.</span></h2>

<p>As early as sunrise on the morning of September
twenty-first, twenty-eight hours or more
before the time set for the trial of our friends,
the people from the country roundabout began
to gather, every man, woman and child eager to
learn at the earliest possible moment what might
be the outcome of this first attempt to check the
course of the king's minions.</p>

<p>Before nightfall it was said that there were
not less than three thousand people in and
around Hillsborough. On every hand as far as
the eye could reach, the visitors were camped;
some brought two or three bed-quilts, which
they put up on crotched sticks and a long sapling
as a ridge-pole, a tent that was made to
accommodate as many as could crawl beneath it.
Others utilized their carts as sleeping quarters,
the body of the vehicle serving as the upper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
story of the dwelling, and the ground immediately
beneath it as the ground floor; to the
wheels were tethered the horses or oxen, and he
who slept in the "chamber" of such a lodging
was in danger of being awakened many times
while the cattle munched at the hay which
served as a bed.</p>

<p>Now a few of the visitors reckoned on sleeping
upon the ground wherever darkness overtook
them, and many there were who had believed
it would be possible to get a shelter in
the town, never dreaming that nearly every
man, woman and child in upper Carolina would
come to the trial, during which was to be settled
the question of their individual rights.</p>

<p>Some of the visitors had brought with them
a goodly supply of provisions, while others,
more improvident, came with nothing save a
hearty appetite, and these last went from party
to party asking food as of right, until all appeared
to be supplied.</p>

<p>Every house in the town was filled to overflowing,
so I was told, at nine o'clock on the
morning of the day before the trial was to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
place. Every tree which could be seen from
our camp had one or more beneath the shelter
of its branches, and in order to prevent our
encampment from being literally over-run, it was
necessary to station fifty men as guards to keep
back our friends.</p>

<p>Take it all in all it was such a sight as I had
never seen before, and do not expect to witness
again. I had not believed there were so many people
in the upper Carolina as were now gathered
here, and every one appeared to be feverishly
eager to make certain Masters Husband and
Hunter would receive a fair trial.</p>

<p>Sidney and I had come off from sentinel duty
at sunrise, when the crowd began to pour in,
and we stood literally fascinated by the scene,
never so much as thinking of breakfast, until the
forenoon was nearly half spent, by which time
the valley between us and the town was densely
packed with human beings.</p>

<p>"I wonder what Tryon thinks of this scene?"
my comrade said musingly as he looked across
the sea of heads from which came a perfect
Babel of noise. "He must realize by this time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
that his imitation army could not make much
progress against such a gathering."</p>

<p>"Aye, and yet it is to his advantage, if he
counts on playing us false," I replied, seized by
a sudden thought. "The Regulators could not
enter the town whatever might be the necessity
for their so doing, save at the expense of trampling
hundreds beneath the feet of their horses."</p>

<p>"That is a danger which I had not considered,"
my comrade said with a long indrawing
of the breath as when one brings himself to face
a sudden and immediate danger. "Governor
Tryon is guarded by his enemies, and yet if they
turned upon him he would be swept from off
the face of the earth like so much chaff before
the wind."</p>

<p>"The disaster would be appalling if these
people should take it into their heads to rise
against him!" I cried, shuddering as if the
work of slaughter was about to begin. "The
soldiers could mow great swaths through the
crowd at every discharge of their muskets, and
hundreds would be killed before the remainder
found space in which to move."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>"He will not dare work an injustice upon the
prisoners!" Sidney cried after a long pause, and
I, sickening as I realized what might happen if
a sudden panic arose, or in case an act of violence
was committed, drew my comrade away
from contemplation of the scene, as I said:</p>

<p>"Why speculate as to possibilities? No
disaster can come upon them during this day at
least, and there is time enough in which to cross
a bridge when we have arrived at it. Let us go
in search of something to eat."</p>

<p>It was not necessary to spend very much
time in this last quest; each visitor who had
relatives among the Regulators brought something
in the way of provisions as a treat, with
the result that our larder was filled to running
over, and it was almost impossible to take a
dozen steps in either direction without receiving
a hearty invitation "to have something from
home."</p>

<p>Up to this time none of Sidney's relatives or
mine had put in an appearance, and I was feeling
decidedly disappointed, although I had no
good reason for believing that my mother would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
come all the way from Alamance simply to learn
what might be the result of Governor Tryon's
investigations.</p>

<p>When we had satisfied our hunger, however,
and were about to visit General Hamilton's
headquarters in order to learn whether we would
be called upon for further guard duty that day,
I was rejoiced beyond words to see my mother,
in company with Sidney's parents, looking here
and there anxiously, disappointed at not readily
finding father or myself.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to say that within a very
few seconds I was clasped in her dear arms, and
for the time being I almost forgot that such a
tyrant as Tryon ever had an existence.</p>

<p>When I had spent an hour in her company,
my father joined us, and at the same moment
Sidney shouted for me to come with him&mdash;where,
I did not at the instant understand.</p>

<p>"It is my intention to stay very near my
mother this day," I said petulantly, as he went
toward the river even while I was advancing.
"She will be setting out for home immediately
after the trials have been brought to a close,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
and I have no idea of wasting even a moment
which might be spent in her company."</p>

<p>"Give her a chance to talk with your father,"
Sidney said laughingly. "It appears to me as
if the visitors were in some mischief down this
way, and I cannot find any of the Regulators
who are willing to look into the matter."</p>

<p>"If it was of consequence there would be no
lack of men to attend to it," I said petulantly,
and then I became interested immediately as I
saw a throng of an hundred or more, who appeared
to be deeply intent upon something in
their midst.</p>

<p>"Most likely they are having some kind of a
game," Sidney said when I came alongside;
"but just before you showed yourself I fancied
I heard cries for help, and it seems as if we
should know the reason for the gathering. Unless
we of the association have our eyes about
us this day there will be rough play which may
develop into a fight, as I heard General Hamilton
say."</p>

<p>By this time we were among those of the
throng who were in the outer ring, and I heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
such cries as: "Drown the scoundrel!" "Be sure
he don't get away till we from Chatham have put
our mark on him!" "He's needed a lesson this
many a day, and now is the time to give it to
him!"</p>

<p>The crowd was so dense as each member of
it pressed toward the center, that Sidney and I
were forced to literally fight our way forward,
and no less than ten minutes were spent in such
task, during which time we plainly heard cries
for help in a voice which sounded strangely
familiar to me.</p>

<p>Then, finally, we were in the very midst of
the gathering, and had before us what promised
to be a tragedy which might bring shame and
reproach upon us all, unless it was speedily
checked.</p>

<p>As many men as could seize upon him, held
in their grasp Sandy Wells, whose legs and
arms were tied securely, and whose clothing had
been torn to tatters by the rough usage he had
received.</p>

<p>His captors were industriously engaged in
kicking him when we gained a place by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
side, and at every blow they called aloud the
name of some citizen of the Carolinas who had
been ill-treated at his hands.</p>

<p>"We're going to square accounts for all our
neighbors, and then dump you in the river,"
one of the men cried vindictively, and I could
see a huge rock, around which was a rope, lying
near at hand to fasten on his body when the tormentors
were ready to put an end to their victim.</p>

<p>Now it cannot be supposed that either Sidney
or I had any affection for the sheriff's officer;
but yet we could not stand idly by while he
was being murdered.</p>

<p>In addition to such pity as common humanity
dictated, it suddenly occurred to me that if the
mob killed an officer of the law the Regulation
would be accused by Governor Tryon of having
committed the deed, and then would be good
reason why the entire upper portion of the
colony should be put under strict martial rule.
If this murder was done the Sons of Liberty
would be branded as assassins, and with some
reason, therefore I whispered to Sidney, although
without the slightest idea as to how we two might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
prevent the enraged men from working their
will:</p>

<p>"We must put an end to this, and that right
quickly, else will the man be killed before our
eyes."</p>

<p>There was in his mind the same thought as
had come into mine, and he turned to look
me full in the face as he said, almost shouting
in order that I might hear the words above the
uproar:</p>

<p>"It may cost us our lives to interfere! I do
not recognize any of these men, and they will
refuse to listen."</p>

<p>At this moment Sandy Wells caught sight of
us, and, stretching out his bound hands, cried
imploringly:</p>

<p>"Save me, lads! For God's sake don't allow
me to be murdered!"</p>

<p>"That we won't!" I cried, suddenly forgetting
that I was running my nose into very serious
danger until we could make that maddened
desperate mob understand who we were, which
last would require some time while the tumult
was so great.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>Forcing myself with a rush between two of
those who had a hold upon Sandy, I seized the
prisoner by the arm as I cried with the full force
of my lungs:</p>

<p>"You are ruining the cause of freedom when
you lay violent hands upon this man! Have a
care, or there'll be mischief done to more than
him!"</p>

<p>I had hardly finished speaking before half a
dozen rushed forward, one seizing me by the
throat, despite all Sidney's efforts to hold him
back, and crying:</p>

<p>"Here's another of Tryon's friends! we'll drop
him into the stream to bear the tax-collector
company!"</p>

<p>I tried in vain to speak; but the fellow had
my throat as if in a vise, and it was impossible
to so much as whisper.</p>

<p>As the mob pressed yet further I was forced
downward until I lay across Sandy's body, and
Sidney strove valiantly to make himself heard
as he cried:</p>

<p>"He whom you have there is Clare Butler,
one of the Regulators! I am Sidney Hubbard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
also a member of the association! Do you
hear? We are of the Regulation, and are trying
to prevent you from bringing yet greater wrongs
upon the colony!"</p>

<p>Before it was possible for Sidney to utter
many words the men had bound me hand and
foot, after the same fashion as was Sandy, and
at that moment I believed, and feel certain to
this day, that death was very near me. It was
only a question as to whether my comrade could
make himself heard before I was pitched overboard.</p>

<p>Already I could hear shouts from those in
the rear demanding that I be "finished" before
Sandy's score was paid off, and more than one
threatened to take a hand in the business if it
was not brought to a speedy close.</p>

<p>"Drown the villain! Let Tryon understand
that he can't play fast and loose with us!" one
of the crowd shouted, and another added:</p>

<p>"Waste no time over him; but let us pay our
dues to the tax-collector while he is drowning."</p>

<p>Those in the rear were so eager to expedite
matters that they flung themselves forward until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
the men who held me were forced to turn and
defend themselves lest they be trodden under
foot, and this temporary delay, I firmly believe,
was all that saved my life.</p>

<p>Had the members of the mob not fought with
each other to gain a better place in which to
witness the spectacle, of a verity I would have
been flung into the river.</p>

<p>"We are two lads who acted as escort to the
deputies when they went to Brunswick!" Sidney
shouted during a momentary lull in the tumult,
and one of those nearest him caught the import
of the words.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" the man cried, and Sidney
replied, yelling in the fellow's ear to make certain
the words were understood:</p>

<p>"Regulators! Members of the association!
But for the lad you are threatening to drown,
the deputies might not have escaped from those
whom Tryon sent in pursuit of us!"</p>

<p>Now it was Sidney had assistance in his
efforts to procure for us a hearing, for the man set
about making his neighbor acquainted with
the facts, and in a twinkling a third understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
that they had been trying to kill their
friends.</p>

<p>When perhaps five minutes had passed, and
time moved slowly to me who was expecting
each instant that some impatient one would
pitch me over the river bank, those in the
middle of the throng came to know what we
had been trying to tell them, and in a very few
seconds afterward I was released from my bonds.</p>

<p>"It was a close shave for you," he who had
been holding me by the throat said, as I stood
before him gasping for breath. "We made certain
you were trying to save the tax-collector."</p>

<p>"That is exactly what we were doing," I replied,
speaking with difficulty because my windpipe
was sore from the pressure so lately put
upon it.</p>

<p>"Then you must be friendly to Tryon, else you
would not speak a good word for that villain
whom we count on killing as we would a rat!"</p>

<p>"It must not be done!" I cried frantically,
raising my voice so that those in the immediate
vicinity might hear. "If you kill him it will be
said that it was done by orders of the Regulation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
and Tryon will have right on his side when he
overruns the country with soldiers. To raise
your hands against an officer of the county is to
weave a noose for those brave men in prison who
will look to-morrow for your assistance! Nothing
would please Tryon better than to have a
reasonable excuse for throwing us all into jail!"</p>

<p>Then, as my voice failed, Sidney took up the
theme:</p>

<p>"How much do you harm Tryon by killing
Sandy Wells? The governor cares nothing about
such as he, and would gladly reward the man
who, by committing murder almost in the encampment
of the Regulators, should give the
king's minions power over us! Turn the tax-collector
over to us. We will take him to General
Hamilton, who is bound to see that he be
held a prisoner, and to-morrow, if Tryon and
Fanning play us false, we shall have one on
whom to retaliate."</p>

<p>"Keep him till to-morrow!" a voice cried, and
straightway I began to have hope that we might
finally succeed in our purpose.</p>

<p>Some of the mob came to understand that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
which we would beat into their thick skulls, and
with the knowledge of what the murder of a
king's officer might mean for all in that section,
whether innocent or guilty, came the impulse to
wash their own hands of any participation in the
outrage.</p>

<p>For the time being they forgot their victim
while discussing each with another the situation
as we had shown it, and now was come the time
when I could cut Sandy's bonds.</p>

<p>"Get to your feet and keep close behind Sidney
and me," I whispered. "Do as I bid you, and
it may be that we three can make our way
inside the lines of the encampment."</p>

<p>"I'll do whatever you say," Sandy replied in
the tone of one whose life has just been saved,
as indeed his had, and I whispered in Sidney's
ear, for the tumult had so far subsided that it
was possible to speak with some degree of privacy:</p>

<p>"Work gradually toward the encampment
while you talk. If we can attract the attention
of the Regulators our point is gained."</p>

<p>Then I turned to argue with the man nearest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
me, showing him how much it would advantage
us if we could have the tax-collector as our prisoner
until the trial in the court had come to an
end, and all the while pressing gently forward,
step by step, toward our line of guards.</p>

<p>Sandy, knowing that his only chance for life
was in keeping close to us lads, for if he had attempted
to gain the village an hundred hands
would have been laid upon him in anger, obeyed
my commands to the letter, pressing me so hard
at times that I found it difficult to keep my
footing.</p>

<p>In this manner we succeeded, after more than
an hour had passed, in approaching within
twenty feet of the encampment line, and the
remainder of the task was simple.</p>

<p>We had but to attract the attention of the
guard, and in a twinkling half a dozen Regulators
were on the spot.</p>

<p>Hurriedly I told our friends of what had been
on foot, and Sandy Wells was marched directly
within the lines, while those who would follow
were forced by the guards to keep their distance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p>The men who had come to our rescue believed
it proper the prisoner should be taken to that
lean-to known as "headquarters," and soon the
miserable wretch was telling his story to our
commander.</p>

<p>"Why did you show yourself such a simpleton
as to venture into the midst of those whom you
had harassed?" the old general asked with a
laugh, for I believe he was secretly pleased at
seeing the tax-collector in such a plight.</p>

<p>"I came across the river to speak with some
friends of mine who were come&mdash;&mdash;" Sandy
began, and one of our party interrupted him by
saying:</p>

<p>"I didn't suppose you had a friend outside
of Hillsborough, and but precious few in the
town!"</p>

<p>"This was a family from Chatham whom I
have known many years&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I venture to say you never tried to collect
illegal taxes from them!"</p>

<p>"Let the man tell the story," General Hamilton
interrupted, and Sandy continued:</p>

<p>"They were so near the town that I didn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
think any one would dare lay hands on me;
but before I was comfortably seated under
their wagon half a dozen men seized me. I
was dragged up the stream to that point where
the bank is high and steep, and there the life
was nearly kicked out of me."</p>

<p>Sandy concluded the story by explaining
how we had chanced to go to his rescue, and
what happened after we arrived at the scene.</p>

<p>"You two lads have done well!" the old
general said emphatically. "It would have
been a sorry day's work for the people in this
section if yonder rascal had been killed. The
one question now in my mind is, what we shall
do with him. I don't want such scurvy knaves
in camp."</p>

<p>Hearing this Sandy dropped on his knees,
begging the general not to send him outside
the lines of the encampment lest he be killed,
and, after waiting a moment without hearing
anything by way of suggestion as to what
should be done with the fellow, Sidney said:</p>

<p>"If it please you, Master Hamilton, Clare
and I will take charge of him until to-morrow.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
I think he will do as we command, and it's
only a question of keeping him away from the
visitors."</p>

<p>"You may take him and welcome," the general
said in a tone of relief. "It may not be
safe to make too great a display of the rascal
even in camp, for we have among us many
whom he has wofully distressed."</p>

<p>"Always acting under orders, sir, always under
orders!" Sandy cried, yet on his knees.</p>

<p>"You would be more of a man if you took
your orders from a different source," the general
said sharply, and then motioned for us to lead
him away.</p>

<p>"You lads have saved my life," Sandy began
when we three were walking toward the lean-to
Sidney and I had built, "and if I can ever
do anything in return, you shall understand
that I know how to be grateful."</p>

<p>"We've done nothing for which we expect
to be rewarded," Sidney replied with a gesture
of impatience. "You can't fancy that we bear
you any very good-will, therefore what we did
was for the good of the colony."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind why you did it; I shall never
forget what I owe."</p>

<p>Then we were come to the lean-to, and once
there the question arose as to what we should
do with our charge. If he was left to wander
around the encampment alone, some of the men
would undoubtedly ill-treat him, and we were
not disposed to waste time which should be
spent in the company of our dear ones, looking
after him.</p>

<p>It was Sandy himself who solved the question
for us, by saying:</p>

<p>"Leave me here; I can hide beneath the
brush which forms your bed, and you may be
certain I shan't be such a fool as to venture
out."</p>

<p>It was a good idea, and after he had burrowed
beneath the pine branches until no trace
of him could be seen, I went to seek my mother.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="s08">TRYON'S DEMONSTRATION.</span></h2>

<p>Although we, meaning Sidney and I, had
saved a man's life, it was but a trifling incident
to the majority, so intense was the interest
in the outcome of the trial to be held on
the morrow.</p>

<p>The welfare of the colony, and, perhaps, the
lives of hundreds of our people depended upon
what would be done next day in the Hillsborough
court-house, and with such a great stake
at hazard, the citizens might well be excused for
giving but little heed to the fact that a tax-collector
had been very near death.</p>

<p>Those who paid any particular attention to
the events which I have just set down, viewed
the entire proceeding as but the first move in
the game betwixt rulers and those who are
ruled, and if any disquietude was felt, it arose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
from the fact that the more superstitious took
Sandy Wells' escape from death as a token that
our oppressors would win the legal battle, or
contrive some way by which it might be turned
into a farce.</p>

<p>When I rejoined my parents I found them
looking decidedly uncomfortable in mind, and
it was possible to guess the reason for their
anxiety when mother said to me in a low tone
as she clasped my hand lovingly:</p>

<p>"My son, in case it should not be prudent
to return home at once, I feel confident you will
conduct yourself as if my eyes were upon you
all the time."</p>

<p>"Then father thinks Tryon will get the best
of us to-morrow?" I cried, looking up quickly.</p>

<p>"It is possible that, despite all our show of
force, the king's party may outwit us, or force
the judges to decide in Tryon's favor," my
father replied thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"If that should happen the people would
make quick work of the traitors," I said, thinking
of the scene I had just witnessed.</p>

<p>"No one can say when or how a gathering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
like this is to be swerved from its purpose.
Within four and twenty hours the situation may
appear entirely different to those who now cry
out against the king's minions."</p>

<p>"But the Regulators will hold steadfast," I
said quickly. "Having announced themselves
as true Sons of Liberty, they cannot give up the
struggle while right is on their side."</p>

<p>"I know not what may be the result of to-morrow's
trial," my father replied gravely, "and
it is of little use to speculate, as I have already
been led to do by certain questions your mother
asked. We shall know the outcome in due
season."</p>

<p>"But you have intimated to her that it may
be several weeks before I return home, as if believing
the result will be in favor of Tryon's
party," I insisted.</p>

<p>"I have said that it might become necessary
for the Regulation to remain in session some
time and of course, since you are a member,
it will be needful to remain in camp."</p>

<p>I understood that father had indulged in more
forebodings while conversing privately with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
mother, than he cared to have made known to
me, and was not surprised thereat. It had been
in my mind for many hours that the governor
could and would influence the decision of the
court, if he believed it might be done with
safety so far as he personally was concerned,
and it would not have caused me astonishment
had I been told that the case was already settled
without regard to any evidence which might be
submitted.</p>

<p>The judges upon the bench would be Chief
Justice Martin Howard, with Maurice Moore and
Richard Henderson as his associates.</p>

<p>It had been said more than once that to these
gentlemen Tryon's desire was of more importance
than the king's written law, and even General
Hamilton was quoted as having declared that
the words of the decisions in the cases which
were to come up on the morrow would have
been dictated by the man who made of justice
a mockery.</p>

<p>However, when I looked around upon the
vast assembly, and realized that the governor
knew beyond a peradventure that all these people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
would cry out against any additional wrongs,
even to the extent of resorting to arms, I
could not believe he would dare trifle with
them.</p>

<p>Mother, observing the mood into which I had
fallen, bade me forget her words, but not the
substance of them, and to change the current of
thought suggested that father and myself escort
her around the encampment in order that she
might meet our friends.</p>

<p>We were on the point of acceding to what was
really a proposition, when one of the Regulators
came up hurriedly with the word:</p>

<p>"The members of the association are ordered
to fall into line, mounted, and fully armed."</p>

<p>It was a command to be obeyed on the instant,
and as I ran toward my camp to make preparations,
I wondered what could have happened to
give color to such a warlike proceeding.</p>

<p>So far as I was able to see, everything appeared
in much the same condition as when we had
rescued Sandy, yet there could be no question but
that danger threatened from some quarter.</p>

<p>Sidney was by my side before I arrived at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
lean-to, and his first question was as to whether
I knew the meaning of the command.</p>

<p>"I can see nothing to cause alarm, and yet
General Hamilton is far too cautious to do anything
unnecessarily which might provoke a conflict,"
I replied. "At such a time as this it
needs but a spark to set all these men aflame, for
after the many wrongs committed in the king's
name they are like to so much tinder, and our
forming into ranks will arouse them at once."</p>

<p>"If Sandy Wells can stir up the visitors to the
point of murder, it stands our officers in hand to
go slowly and with exceeding caution," Sidney
said in so grave a tone that I looked at him in
surprise.</p>

<p>When we began saddling our horses, which
had been kept within the enclosure that day lest
they might be frightened away, or stolen, the
collector was alarmed, and, poking his head out
from under the brushpile, asked in a voice trembling
with apprehension:</p>

<p>"What is the matter? Have any others from
the sheriff's office been so reckless as to follow my
example by coming across the river?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>"We don't know what is on foot," Sidney replied;
"but certain it is that we are called out
for duty. Take my advice and keep under cover
till night, when we will make an effort to send
you over to the town."</p>

<p>Sandy disappeared like a flash, and despite
the fears in my mind I could not repress the
smile which was provoked by a glimpse of his
face.</p>

<p>The day was exceedingly warm, and his hiding-place
must have been close indeed, for not a
breath of air could reach him beneath all that
brush. His cheeks were flushed crimson, and the
perspiration oozed from every pore, only to be
covered with pine needles which adhered to the
skin as if glued there.</p>

<p>We were not long in answering the call, and
once my comrade and I were on the brow of the
hill overlooking the town, where the command
was being formed, it was possible to understand
why we had been summoned.</p>

<p>Across that sea of heads, just in front of the
court-house, was Governor Tryon's army, drawn
up as if for action. We could see that every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
man was fully armed, and all the officers in
position, ready for immediate movement.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of that display of
force?" I asked in surprise, and the man nearest
me replied grimly:</p>

<p>"That is what all of us would like to know.
It may be that Tryon is only showing the
visitors what he can muster in case of a riot, and
yet such would be a foolish move, for it simply
proves that this multitude could make short work
of them. If I stood in Tryon's shoes I should
hesitate about showing my hand so plainly."</p>

<p>"The fellow is no fool, however much of a
knave he may be," one of the Regulators who had
heard the reply said quickly. "I warrant those
soldiers are not there to overawe the people."</p>

<p>"Then why have they been called out?"
Sidney asked impatiently.</p>

<p>"In my opinion they will march across the
river, or, at least, to a point mighty near this
camp."</p>

<p>"Meaning that the governor counts on showing
fight?" I asked in dismay.</p>

<p>"You are getting beyond me; but the question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
is likely to be answered very soon, for the
men are in motion."</p>

<p>As he spoke the command wheeled into files,
and advanced in order of fours directly toward
us. At the head of the column rode three
officers tricked out with gold lace and feathers;
but we could see readily that Tryon himself was
not among them.</p>

<p>By this time the people, who had been aroused
by seeing us form in line as if to resist an attack,
now perceived what was happening on the other
side of the river, and straightway a murmuring
sound arose which was at the same time menacing
and disquieting.</p>

<p>I could see that the male visitors were hurrying
the women and children around to the other
side of the hill, as if expecting a battle was imminent,
while the younger men and older lads
were collecting into a solid mass.</p>

<p>"If yonder fellows were armed, Tryon's recruits
would have a rough time of it," Sidney
said with a laugh as he pointed at the throng
which was edging toward the hill as if to support
us.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>"God forbid that such should be the case,
else Hillsborough would be a shambles this
night," a horseman near me said in a low tone.
"If Tryon begins blood-letting to-day, he and
we alike will rue it."</p>

<p>The soldiers advanced in something like regular
order until they were come to the river
bank, and there, not more than two hundred
yards from where the Regulators and their horses
remained like statues, they came to a halt.</p>

<p>The three officers who had led the column
rode into the stream to a point midway across
the ford, where they also halted.</p>

<p>"It is a parley!" I heard some one near me
mutter, and then came a cry from that officer
whose uniform bore the greatest amount of gold
lace:</p>

<p>"Is there any one who professes to command
your force?"</p>

<p>General Hamilton, attended by Master James
Hunter and my father, rode to the line of the
encampment, and the old Scotchman lifted his
hat in answer to the question.</p>

<p>"Who am I addressing?" the officer asked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
and then it was that I recognized him as the
governor's secretary.</p>

<p>"That you know full well, David Edwards!"
our old commander shouted; "but lest you may
think I'm afraid to bring myself under the ban
of your mock court, I'll repeat it. I am Ninian
Bell Hamilton, a freeholder of this colony,
president of that association known as the
Regulation, and bending the knee to no one
outside of bonny Scotland!"</p>

<p>What a shout went up from the people as the
old gentleman thus boldly announced himself!
It was as if the hill literally trembled because
of the tumult, and not until a good five minutes
had passed was it possible for Master Edwards
to make himself heard.</p>

<p>Then, when the people were hoarse from
much shouting, the secretary cried:</p>

<p>"In the name of the king I bid you disperse!"</p>

<p>"Wherefore?" General Hamilton asked
sharply. "Is it not allowed that the people may
assemble when their court of law is about to
decide upon the fate of two most worthy members
of this colony?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not lawful to menace the king's officers
while they are in discharge of their duty."</p>

<p>"It is you who are menacing, my good man.
We have come here in orderly fashion, and
were doing our best to preserve order when you
marched out in full war array."</p>

<p>"You are inciting the people to deeds of
violence. It is hardly an hour since one of his
majesty's officers was foully murdered by
you who call yourselves Regulators, and I
demand that those who had any hand in that
cowardly deed be delivered up to his excellency's
guard, whereof I am temporarily in
command."</p>

<p>"Whatever is the rascal talking about?" I
heard General Hamilton mutter; but after Master
Hunter had spoken with him, he looked
around as if in search of some person.</p>

<p>I made bold to spur my horse forward a few
paces, believing I understood what the general
would have, and immediately he motioned me
nearer.</p>

<p>"Have you that rascally tax-collector in your
charge, my lad?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye, sir; that is to say, he was in our camp
half an hour since."</p>

<p>"Bring him out here, and we will see if he's
the man yonder popinjay prates about so loudly."</p>

<p>I rode back to our lean-to without loss of time,
and once there called to Sandy.</p>

<p>He poked his head out from amid the brush
like a turtle, and because of the pine needles
which covered his face the best friend he had
in the world would have failed to recognize him.</p>

<p>"The governor's troops have sent for you,"
I said curtly, intent only on performing my
duty in the shortest possible space of time.
"You are to come with me."</p>

<p>"I don't dare, lad, I don't dare!" he cried in
an agony of terror. "You alone amid all this
throng cannot protect me!"</p>

<p>"There will be no throng where you are to go.
The Regulators are drawn up in line, and I give
you my word they will brook no interference
from those who were near to doing murder."</p>

<p>Instead of coming out, he drew back till I
could see no more than the top of his head, and
I was angered because of the delay.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>"The general has sent for you, and I am not
willing to waste time. If you are not by my
side before it is possible to count ten, I'll put a
bullet into your head as you lie there!"</p>

<p>Although I would not have done such a thing
to save my right hand, the coward must have
believed I was in deadly earnest, for he crept
out, shaking with fear like a man suffering from
an ague fit.</p>

<p>"Now march by the side of my horse, holding
to the stirrup," I said sharply. "It will be
well so long as you obey orders; but once I see
any show of running away, my bullet will make
a target of your carcass."</p>

<p>"How could I run away while on every hand
are those who would murder me?" he asked
with a whine. "If the people see me I am undone."</p>

<p>"The governor's troops have come to conduct
you to the town, and surely you may trust
them!" I cried.</p>

<p>Sandy shook his head doubtfully; he was in
that frame of mind where he trusted no one, and
his terror was so great as to excite pity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>I contrived, however, by a liberal use of
threats, to keep him by me until I had arrived
at General Hamilton's side, and then the old
Scotchman bade me advance with Sandy until I
was midway between himself and the three
officers.</p>

<p>"Is that the man you accuse us of murdering?"
the general asked when I had obeyed his
order, and I could see a look of surprise come
over Master Edwards' face.</p>

<p>"Is it Sandy Wells, of the sheriff's office?"
he asked; but my prisoner remained silent,
whereupon I prodded him in the side, whispering
as I did so:</p>

<p>"Speak out, man! Do you distrust your own
friends?"</p>

<p>"I'm not certain if I have any," he said
mournfully, and then so far plucked up courage
as to reply in a thin, tremulous voice:</p>

<p>"Aye, sir, I am Sandy Wells."</p>

<p>"We heard that you had been murdered,"
Master Edwards said, much as if disappointed
because such was not the fact.</p>

<p>"I was indeed very near death; but those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
call themselves Regulators rescued me from the
vile men who accuse me of having worked them
harm because of obeying the sheriff's orders."</p>

<p>"Is that the man you declared had been murdered?"
General Hamilton shouted, and after
some delay Master Edwards replied:</p>

<p>"That is the man."</p>

<p>"Send him forward, lad, and let those brave
gentlemen take the fellow without delay to his
excellency, who will be in distress of mind until
after having assured himself that he is in the
land of the living."</p>

<p>Master Edwards wheeled about as if to join
his force, and General Hamilton shouted:</p>

<p>"Turn back, David Edwards, and take him
who has caused you so much trouble! Why do
you not grasp the gallant gentleman's hand?"</p>

<p>"Come back, please, dear Master Edwards!"
Sandy shouted. "Else I shall be killed, for
the Regulators evidently will have no more
of me!"</p>

<p>At this pathetic appeal the people burst into
a roar of laughter which was like unto the shrieking
of a hurricane, and not until he had crossed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
to the other side of the river did Master Edwards
turn his head.</p>

<p>Then his cheeks were flaming red as with
shame, and I fearing lest we might let slip this
opportunity of safely delivering our prisoner,
said to Sandy:</p>

<p>"Run forward, man, now that you have the
opportunity! It is not certain Sidney and I can
smuggle you into the town, and you may come
to grief on this side the river, no matter how
close you hide yourself."</p>

<p>The tax-collector hesitated only an instant,
and then seeing that there were none between
him and the line of red-coated soldiers, took to
his heels, crying at the full force of his lungs:</p>

<p>"Wait for me, Master Edwards! For the love
of heaven don't leave me here to be murdered,
dear Master Edwards!"</p>

<p>"Wait for the lost sheep which we have
restored to you, Master Secretary!" General
Hamilton shouted, and the people were once
more convulsed with laughter.</p>

<p>They roared and shrieked in mirth until Sandy
was by the side of the angry secretary, and jeered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
both the tax-collector and the soldiers until the
governor's guard fairly ran toward the court-house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I had ridden back to my place in
the line, and, arriving there, heard one horseman
say to his neighbor:</p>

<p>"There will be no further thought of foul play,
now that the people are amused; but if those
two lads had not rescued the tax-collector when
he was nigh to death, we should have a pretty
hornets' nest about our ears by this time."</p>

<p>It filled me with pride as I realized that
Sidney and I had done so much for the cause,
and I could well understand how important was
our work of mercy, by glancing at the governor's
troops.</p>

<p>Had Sandy Wells been killed, as he would
have been but for us two lads, then had Tryon
such a weapon against us as must have doomed
the Regulation to everlasting shame and contempt.</p>

<p>We held our line until the governor's soldiers
disappeared behind the court-house, and then the
command was given to break ranks, after which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
General Hamilton rode up to Sidney and me, saying
as he faced about to check our forward
movement:</p>

<p>"I thank you, lads, in the name of the Regulation,
for having made it possible for us to
throw ridicule upon the enemy. May you ride
long in the ranks of the Sons of Liberty!"</p>

<p>I was as proud as any turkey cock at being
publicly praised by one of the foremost men in
the colony, and when we were alone in our
lean-to Sidney said:</p>

<p>"I reckon we ought to be well satisfied with
ourselves. There's many a one in this company
who would give half he possessed to win such
words as we received from the general."</p>

<p>"But for you Sandy would have been killed,
and the governor had just cause to imprison
every Regulator he could come at. I have
taken my share of the praise, but without having
earned it."</p>

<p>"I say you're entitled to as much as myself,"
the lad cried hotly. "I had no idea anything
very serious was on foot when I dragged you
from your mother, and once we were in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
crowd it was impossible to do other than exactly
as we did."</p>

<p>Sidney's generous heart prompted him to give
me a full share in the work when I had but followed
him, and during the remainder of that day
I took good care to make every one who spoke
of the matter understand exactly the position
of affairs.</p>

<p>When my horse had been tethered I sought
out mother once more, and she sang my praises
till my cheeks were red with something very
like shame, for she would not listen to the explanations
I made; but insisted on calling
me "a brave lad" who was an honor to his
parents.</p>

<p>A stranger who had come suddenly upon us
during the afternoon of this day would have
found it difficult to believe that we were ready
for, and expecting, mischief on the morrow.</p>

<p>The scene on the hill and nearabout the river
was rather one of peace and good-will. Neighbors
and friends seemed bent on a holiday, with
no thought of care, and yet their merry-making
was carried on between two small armies, each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
prepared to meet the other in deadly conflict if
provocation was given.</p>

<p>It was a scene of gaiety which might be entirely
changed by the morrow, and then instead
of smiles one could expect to see tears; instead
of laughter, to hear groans of agony, unless God
should put it in the heart of William Tryon to
deal justly and lawfully by those over whom the
king had set him.</p>

<p>It was with some such thoughts as these that
I looked down from the brow of the hill upon
the joyous throng, and my heart grew sick with
apprehension as I speculated upon that which
the morrow's sun might bring to light.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="s08">THE LONG NIGHT.</span></h2>

<p>The excitement of the people appeared to increase
rather than diminish as the night approached.</p>

<p>The appearance of the king's soldiers had disturbed
them in their merry-making, and brought
to their minds the possibilities of the morrow.
A view of the two armed bodies, drawn up one
against the other, told more clearly of the danger
which threatened than words could have
done, and the cautious began to ask if it would
not be well to send the women and children
away.</p>

<p>Dull-witted though I am, I could not fail to
observe the people casting furtive glances toward
the town, as if fearing to see issuing from it
those who would work some injury in the name
of the king.</p>

<p>The sounds of laughter were replaced by deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
mutterings, and instead of lounging here or there
with their families, the men and boys moved restlessly
from one point to another, watching jealously
every motion of the Regulators.</p>

<p>It was much as if we were all walking to and
fro in a magazine of powder, each with a lighted
match in his hand, and that the explosion was
a foregone conclusion, the only question being
as to exactly when it would occur.</p>

<p>I understood that others besides myself took
much the same view of the situation, when the
officers of the Regulation gave orders concerning
that which should be done during the night.</p>

<p>All the company were ordered to go on duty
at sunset, remaining under arms until morning,
ready for any sudden emergency. The men were
especially commanded not to stray away from
the limits of the encampment, and forty were
told off to do guard duty when ten could have
patrolled the camp thoroughly under ordinary
circumstances.</p>

<p>All these preparations told that our leaders
were anxious regarding the possibility of treachery
on the part of the royalists, which was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
to be wondered at in view of all that had happened.</p>

<p>When it was reported in Hillsborough that
Sandy Wells had been murdered, Tryon and
Fanning saw an opportunity of setting us down
before the world at large as murderers and knaves
who should, in justice to a law-abiding community,
be committed to jail.</p>

<p>When they learned that we had kept our
hands clean, that we had done our best to preserve
the peace, it might well be expected some
other plan to ruin us would be tried, and General
Hamilton was far too wise a man to neglect
any opportunity for additional defense.</p>

<p>It was also evident that the people generally
were of the belief that the royalists would attempt
to do us a mischief, and, as I have said,
they moved around restlessly, watching keenly
all that was taking place on the opposite side
of the river.</p>

<p>Had the king's troops come toward the ford
a second time, I believe of a verity that trouble
would have ensued even though the soldiers
advanced with peaceful intent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>Sidney and I were stationed as sentinels at
that part of the line which overlooked the
town, with orders to observe closely all that might
be taking place on the opposite side of the
river, and to report immediately at headquarters
any unusual movement, either on the part of
the royalists or visitors.</p>

<p>Every inch of the line which marked the
bounds of the encampment was constantly traversed
that night. The guards were stationed
twenty feet apart, and it was expressly commanded
that each man should advance until
he met the sentinel on his right, when he was
to wheel about and proceed in the opposite
direction until meeting the Regulators on his
left, continuing this throughout the hours of
darkness.</p>

<p>The numerous fires kindled by the visitors
with which to cook supper, or keep off the
insects, served to illumine the scene, and on the
opposite side of the river one could see the
streets closely packed with human beings, who
counted to spend the night in the open air.</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock in the evening, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
was yet doing guard duty, when a sudden outburst
of noise from near about the court-house
startled us, for it seemed to be the signal of
that uprising or outbreak which we had been
fearing might occur before morning.</p>

<p>At first it was no more than angry cries and
yelps of pain; but these increased steadily
until it seemed as if a riot was well under
way.</p>

<p>There was no need of carrying any information
to the headquarters' shanty. General
Hamilton was on the guard line very near to
my post, within two minutes after the first cries
were heard, and he remained there in a listening
attitude, turning his head this way and that
like the dog who seeks to find a lost trail.</p>

<p>A dozen or more of the chief men were with
him, and I heard one of them ask anxiously:</p>

<p>"Can you guess why trouble should have
begun at this time? I believed all the hot
heads among our friends were on this side of
the river."</p>

<p>"So they are, else would the brawl have been
fanned into a battle long before this. Master
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Hunter," he cried sharply to the deputy, "form
your men into line at the river bank to prevent
any from leaving the encampment, and lose no
time in doing so."</p>

<p>At the call for the guards to advance into
line I stepped forward; but stopped very suddenly
as the general seized me by the collar of
my shirt.</p>

<p>"You and the comrade who aided in saving
Sandy Wells' life are to wait here that I may
have a moment's speech with you." Then,
raising his voice, he cried, "Hunter, give the
word as soon as you have a force at the riverbank
sufficient to hold this throng in check!"</p>

<p>"The entire Regulation will be none too
many for such service as that."</p>

<p>"Station the guards first, and then call out
the remainder of the force. It stands us in
hand to hold all on this side the river, and also
keep peace among them."</p>

<p>I was at some little trouble to find Sidney,
he having gone to the further end of the line
when the word was given to "fall in"; but I
succeeded in withdrawing him from the ranks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
just as the men went forward into position at
the river bank.</p>

<p>When we two lads stood before him, the
general said in a low tone as if to prevent any
other from hearing the discourse:</p>

<p>"It is in my mind that yonder riot has been
begun by orders of Tryon or Fanning, that
they may have some excuse for filling the jail
before morning, as well as to cast discredit upon
the Regulation. You lads have shown yourselves
quick-witted, and I have no doubt that
you will be able to hold your own in case Tryon
and his crew are provoking a brawl. Cross
the river at once; mingle with those who are
taking part in the disturbance, and learn all
you can regarding the beginning of the trouble."</p>

<p>"Our lines are in position!" Master Hunter
cried, and the general replied:</p>

<p>"Very well. Hold the people here, and allow
none to cross save the two who may speedily
come with my permission to do as they please."</p>

<p>We lads waited twenty seconds or more to
learn if Master Hamilton had any further commands
for us, and since he did not speak, Sidney
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
plucked me by the sleeve as a signal that
we should set out.</p>

<p>The general was looking at us when we
moved off, therefore did I know that we had
received all the orders he had to give.</p>

<p>On coming to the water's edge we walked
up the stream until finding Master Hunter, and
then, in a low tone, explained what we had
been ordered to do.</p>

<p>He immediately directed the men to give us
passage, and hurriedly we forded the stream,
bending our steps toward the court-house after
having gained the opposite bank.</p>

<p>It was not a simple matter to make our way
through the crowded street. By this time
nearly all the people who had encamped in the
open air were astir, and every man and boy was
pressing eagerly forward to that point from
whence came the outcries.</p>

<p>By dint of using our elbows sharply, and
forcing aside without ceremony those who
barred the way, we succeeded, at the risk
of embroiling ourselves in private quarrels, in
gaining a position near the center of the disturbance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
when it was possible to perceive at a
glance that General Hamilton was correct in his
surmises.</p>

<p>The visitors were not raising their hands
against the soldiers save when great provocation
was given; but here and there I could see
those who were in some way connected with
the government, and among them Sandy Wells,
making their way from point to point, dealing
blows and uttering insults well calculated to
raise a disturbance.</p>

<p>Whenever one of the visitors attempted to
defend himself, or would have punished the
insulter, the minions of Tryon raised a great hue
and cry to bring the solders to that point, after
which they slipped off to create a disturbance
at some other point.</p>

<p>But for the fact that the visitors had been
warned against giving the governor an opportunity
for complaint, a riot would have been
begun within a very few minutes, and with such
a degree of violence that it might have increased
to a regular battle; but as it was, our people
behaved with remarkable moderation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>I believed that we might do much good by advice,
and suggested to Sidney that we go hastily
around among the throng, explaining what was
the evident purpose of the governor's minions,
at the same time advising every one to cross the
river immediately, lest by their behavior Tryon
should have some color of a reason for postponing
the cases which had been set down for a
hearing next day.</p>

<p>He was of my opinion, and without delay we
began our work, hurrying here or there with
such good effect that the people began to fall
back before the mischief breeders, instead of
pressing forward.</p>

<p>This was not at all to the liking of those who
desired to provoke a breach of the peace, and they
redoubled their efforts, offering yet greater indignities
to the unresisting citizens.</p>

<p>Foremost among these was Sandy Wells, and
I made it my business to gain a position close
by his side, when I said, holding him by the
arm until the words had been uttered:</p>

<p>"Sidney Hubbard and I saved your life this
day, as you well know. It can readily be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
seen what you are trying to do, and unless you
cease your efforts I will take good care before
the sun sets to-morrow, to inflame every man's
mind against you. That fate which was escaped
this afternoon shall overtake you within the
next four and twenty hours, even though Tryon
gives you shelter in his own quarters."</p>

<p>Sandy was a rank coward, as I well knew,
and when my hold of his sleeve was relaxed he
slunk away among the soldiers, nor did I see
him again that night.</p>

<p>During more than an hour Sidney and I continued
our efforts, sometimes threatened by the
soldiers or Tryon's emissaries, and then the
throng had so far dispersed that there were not
enough hot-heads left to make any very great
disturbance, even though they felt disposed to
resist the troops.</p>

<p>"Now the enemies of the colony can do no
more than foment an ordinary brawl, which is
not what Tryon most desires, and I believe our
work here is done in accordance with the general's
orders," Sidney said to me as we met among
the foremost of the small crowd, within a short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
distance of where the uniformed men were drawn
up in line. "If we are recognized you may be
certain those fellows will use every effort to
lodge us in jail, and it is wise to beat a retreat
while we may."</p>

<p>I was of much the same opinion, and, after
gathering half a dozen of the wilder spirits in
our wake, we set off toward the ford, hooted
and jeered at by those who had most signally
failed in the task assigned them.</p>

<p>The sudden change in the situation of affairs
was truly surprising. When we two lads first
crossed the river we found the streets literally
choked with men, women and children who
counted on remaining there with the hope of
gaining admittance to the court-house as soon
as the day dawned; but now it was as if
the earth had opened and swallowed all these
people.</p>

<p>We did not meet with twenty as we went
toward the ford; they had wisely crossed the
river, and, once on the opposite side, the Regulators
would keep them quiet.</p>

<p>We had checked the governor's scheme, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
through force of arms, but simply by removing
those who might unwittingly have aided
him in his unlawful efforts.</p>

<p>Once the visitors were on that side of the
river held by the Regulators, they were unable to
go back; but all who called themselves Sons of
Liberty would be forced to remain on duty during
the entire night in order to hold in check
those who counted themselves friendly to the
cause.</p>

<p>As a matter of course Sidney and I reported
to General Hamilton as soon as possible, and
when we had concluded our story the old Scotchman
said in a tone of satisfaction:</p>

<p>"I knew full well I could depend upon you
lads to do whatsoever was wise. By sending the
people over here you have accomplished a good
work, and once again is Tryon defeated by your
unaided efforts. The Regulation has good reason
to count you as valuable members, and
when the time comes that this colony can reward
the services of those who have aided her, as
come it will in due season, I hope I may be
alive to make certain you are not neglected."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>According to my way of thinking we were
already rewarded by such words as these, and
but for the darkness Master Hamilton would
have seen my cheeks crimsoned with shame because
he had given us far more than we deserved.</p>

<p>It was but natural that there should be considerable
confusion on our side of the river; all
who had lately changed their camping places
were seeking for new quarters, and already
the slope of the hill outside the lines of our
encampment was literally covered with human
beings.</p>

<p>The late comers were compelled to find a resting-place
on the other side of the elevation, and
thus were our horsemen literally hemmed in.
If it should become necessary to make a quick
movement, it would require some time to clear
the ground in order to avoid trampling the
visitors beneath the hoofs of our horses.</p>

<p>Every member of the Regulation was now
doing guard duty, and as soon as Sidney and I
had concluded our interview with the general,
we joined our comrades, when the weary work
of pacing to and fro was resumed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>At the river front remained a line of Regulators
who allowed any person to come over;
but refused passage to such as would have gone
back, and thus we held the key to the situation
so far as keeping the peace was concerned.</p>

<p>Until this last move of Governor Tryon's I
think the majority of our people believed the
king's officers would not dare do other than
give the prisoners a fair trial, although perhaps
no one was convinced that it was more than a
farce to bring Fanning before the bar.</p>

<p>Now, however, when we had good proof as
to the lengths Tryon was ready to go, and could
see plainly that he was using every effort to place
the Regulation in a false light before the world,
there was much doubt as to the outcome of the
cases in court.</p>

<p>The Regulators on duty discussed the matter
among themselves as if it was a foregone conclusion
that might, not right, would rule, and
such of the visitors as I heard conversing were
loud in their declarations that justice must
prevail even though it should be purchased by
force.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>"There is likely to be hot times to-morrow,"
Sidney said to me as we halted an instant when
everything seemed peaceful. "If we are brought
face to face with Tryon's army, much blood will
be shed on both sides before the question is
settled definitely."</p>

<p>"But that blood will cement the colonies in
such manner that oppression in one will be felt
by all the others. We shall have effected a
union, and what are our lives in comparison
to such a consummation?" a voice said, and, turning,
I saw Master James Hunter, who had come
up in time to overhear our conversation.</p>

<p>"Then you believe we shall fight a battle to-morrow,
sir?" I made bold to say, and he
replied with a sigh:</p>

<p>"Of that I am not so certain. If we do, the
colonies will declare for freedom against the
king's rule. If peace is preserved throughout
the morrow, then must greater wrongs be endured
in order to provoke the people into demanding
their full rights."</p>

<p>Having said this the deputy continued on his
rounds, and we two lads no longer had any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
desire to discuss the situation, for it had become
so grave, according to Master Hunter, that a
bloody battle between us and those on the
opposite side of the river seemed suddenly to
be really desirable.</p>

<p>During the remainder of that long night we
lads did our full share of guard duty, I dwelling
upon the possibilities until the old timorousness
came upon me, and I was almost a coward.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that death would come
within a few hours, and I was already marked
out as one of his victims. I found myself wondering
if I could march up to the guns of the
enemy without betraying the cowardice in my
heart, and otherwise spending the time in a very
foolish fashion for one who must play the part
of soldier.</p>

<p>Never had the dawning of a new day been
so much of a relief to me as then. The gray
light of morning revealed the multitude sleeping
peacefully, and on the opposite bank not even
a wreath of smoke showed above the chimney-tops.</p>

<p>The scene brought relief to me, and by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
time the sun rose I was able to keep down the
fear in my heart, so that no one might suspect
that I was in very fact a coward.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful scene when the visitors
awakened to life, and began making ready for
the coming events which were of concern to all
dwelling in America. This day's sun would
see the dawn of freedom, or a postponement
of that spirit which must in the near future
descend upon our people.</p>

<p>The officers of the Regulation went from
camp to camp, cautioning the visitors against
making any demonstration before the trials at
the court-house were brought to a close, and at
the ford a group of our best citizens was performing
the same task.</p>

<p>If the citizens of upper Carolina made any
error on this day it would not be from lack of
advice from those who were in a position to
know what might be best for the colony.</p>

<p>The one aim of the people was to reach the
court-house in order to gain admission as spectators,
and although the building would not accommodate
one in every hundred who were eager
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
to enter, the thousands flocked thither, jostling
and pushing each other in order to get a position
among the foremost.</p>

<p>General Hamilton did all a man could to persuade
them into remaining at a respectful distance,
pointing out the uselessness of expecting
to gain admittance; but yet they made their
way into the town until our encampment was
deserted by all save the better informed&mdash;say
five hundred men, women and children.</p>

<p>We of the Regulators were ordered to get
breakfast as best we might, and then fall into
the ranks again, for we were to remain under
arms the entire day lest our force might be
needed in defense of the citizens.</p>

<p>"Are we like to be called upon for any serious
service, sir?" I asked of Master Hunter, who
chanced to pass where I was partaking of the
morning meal with my parents, and he replied:</p>

<p>"It is hardly probable. Tryon will not attempt
any more tricks, now that the time of
opening court is so near at hand, and I believe our
people will keep the peace, at least until after
the decision of the judges is made known."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<p>Then the deputy called my father aside, and
the two held such long and earnest converse
that I believed our officers were of the opinion
the trial would be no more than a farce.</p>

<p>This idea was strengthened in my mind when
mother showed such tender affection as I would
leave her to take my place in the line which
was being formed.</p>

<p>She bade me farewell as if believing we might
never meet again, and despite all her efforts the
tears came as she spoke.</p>

<p>I was not heartened by this evidence of fear,
as may well be imagined, and hurried away to
feed my horse in order that I might hide the
evidences of my own emotion.</p>

<p>Half an hour later we of the Regulation
were in something approaching a military formation,
with our horses tethered just in the
rear where we might be able to get at them
without loss of time, and then came the most
trying moment of all-waiting for Governor
Tryon to show how far he dared to go in opposition
to the law and the rights of the
people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>The square around the court-house was black
with citizens awaiting an opportunity to enter
the building. In the midst of this mass could
be seen two files of soldiers standing shoulder
to shoulder in order to keep open a passage for
the officers and witnesses, and a short distance
away were the governor's troops under arms in
case it should please our oppressor to order an
attack upon the helpless throng.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="s08">THE TRIAL.</span></h2>

<p>Now the trial was so near at hand&mdash;when in a
few hours we should know beyond a peradventure
to what lengths Tryon would go in his
villainy towards the people of the Carolinas we
no longer discussed the possibilities of the near
future.</p>

<p>If Masters Husband and William Hunter were
set free, as indeed could be the only just verdict
of the judges, and if Fanning was convicted of
having extorted money from the people without
even the color of the law to sustain him, then
would our colony be peaceful; but I question
if one among all those horsemen who awaited
the signal to disperse quietly or to ride to their
deaths, believed that justice would triumph.</p>

<p>Even two lads like Sidney and myself understood
that the governor would deny us our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
rights, and the thoughts of what might come
to those we loved before the sun had disappeared
behind the hills, rendered us dumb.</p>

<p>I did not see any of the gentlemen conversing.
I threw myself at full length on the grass close
by Sidney's side, and would hardly have heard
him had he spoken.</p>

<p>My eyes were fixed upon the court-house, surrounded
as it was by that vast throng of people,
and I noted every movement, however slight.</p>

<p>When the judges and the officers of the court
marched through the lane formed by the weapons
of the soldiers, I saw them plainly, and could
almost imagine that the voice of the sheriff
rang in my ears as he uttered the words which
opened the sitting.</p>

<p>My father and four other Regulators had gone
into town in order to give evidence against
Fanning, and to combat the charge of "riotous
conduct" which had been preferred against
our friends.</p>

<p>All the other gentlemen of our company remained
on the hillside, save Master Hamilton,
who stood on the highest point in the encampment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
where he might see any signal which our
people should give.</p>

<p>The forenoon passed, and I remained like one in
a stupor. The noon hour went by, and I had no
sensation of hunger. Some of our companions
ate; but they were the ones known to be lukewarm
to the cause.</p>

<p>As I came afterward to know, it was near
about two o'clock in the afternoon when a low
hoarse murmur which was like unto nothing
save the growl of an enraged beast sounded
on our ears. It rose louder and louder, gathering
in angry menace each instant, until it was
of such volume, that one could hardly have
heard a peal of thunder above it, and then we
knew full well that Governor Tryon had trampled
all the laws under his foot&mdash;that it was
our duty to become rebels in fact, by rushing
upon the villainous representative of the king
and cutting him down.</p>

<p>Then came one from the town running at full
speed, and when having come near enough to
make his voice heard, he shouted:</p>

<p>"Master Husband has been acquitted; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
both William and James Hunter and Master
Hamilton have been adjudged guilty, and are
fined one thousand pounds each, in addition to
imprisonment for six months!"</p>

<p>"But James Hunter and Master Hamilton
had not been even charged with crime!" one of
the Regulators cried, doubting the truth of the
news.</p>

<p>"Very true; yet they were tried just the same.
Master James Hunter was taken into custody
as he entered the court-room to give evidence
against Fanning, and a warrant is already issued
for Master Hamilton," the messenger added.</p>

<p>Then Sidney shouted:</p>

<p>"What about Fanning? Has he been acquitted?"</p>

<p>"It is much the same. He was tried on seven
counts for extortion, found guilty, and sentenced
to pay one penny on each indictment. Seven
pence to be paid by the rascally lawyer, and one
thousand pounds each by the Hunters and Master
Hamilton!"</p>

<p>"And the people?" Master Howell demanded.
"What do they say?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>"You can hear for yourself," the man replied,
forced to shout even though he stood close beside
us by this time, because of the tumult in the
vicinity of the court-house. "Before the trial
had come to an end the building was filled with
soldiers, while the remainder of the governor's
force encircled it. If a fight is begun our friends
will be shot down by hundreds, with no opportunity
to strike a blow save with their bare fists."</p>

<p>Without waiting for the word of command
every Regulator mounted his horse, and all of us
waited for the signal from our commander, who
had drawn near to hear the report made by the
messenger.</p>

<p>He stood with his chin on his breast like one
stunned, neither looking up nor speaking, while
the cries from the opposite side of the river
increased in fury each instant.</p>

<p>"Are we to sit here while our friends are imprisoned
without cause?" a horseman near me
asked angrily, and Master Hamilton raised his
head as if to make reply, when some one shouted:</p>

<p>"Here comes Master Husband! They have
set him free!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>The man who had been in jail nearly six
months for having dared to say that Tryon
had no authority to levy a tax to build himself
a palace, could be seen walking rapidly toward
the ford, and all understood that nothing would
be done by us until he arrived.</p>

<p>Master Hamilton rode down to meet him, and
the two remained in private converse five minutes
or more before coming up to where we awaited
them with the utmost impatience.</p>

<p>Then it was that our commander spoke:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, it is our duty to prevent the people
of upper Carolina from beginning a conflict
with the king's troops. We must not permit
ourselves to commit any act of violence against
the governor until after due deliberation, for all
which we do now is the same as if we moved
against the king. By Master Husband's advice,
we shall ride into town, and do our best to
prevent a conflict which would cost the lives
of hundreds of our friends and neighbors. I
beseech you that, however great the provocation,
all this company keep well together in military
formation, and obey every order to the letter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Later, when some of those who are absent can
take part in our deliberations as is their right,
we will settle upon a course of action."</p>

<p>Some one offered Master Husband a horse, on
which he rode by the side of our leader as we
crossed the river and went from thence to the
court-house, or, I should say, as near as it was
possible to advance.</p>

<p>The vast throng were inflamed by anger.
They shouted threats against the soldiers, who
were evidently alarmed by the demonstration, and
had General Hamilton given the signal to make
an attack, I believe of a verity that every man,
whether armed or not, would have joined the
fray.</p>

<p>At seeing us ride up the citizens shouted yet
more loudly; but when we halted, they turned
about to learn the reason of our delay in giving
Tryon a lesson, and Master Hamilton cried out
to them, speaking so loudly that every word
must have been heard by those who yet remained
in the court-room.</p>

<p>"We, the Regulation, beg that you will not put
your lives in jeopardy while unprepared for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
battle. If you will disperse, each sending his
women and children home out of danger, the Regulators
will meet you in solemn deliberation this
evening when our plan of action shall be decided
upon."</p>

<p>"And are we to let Tryon and Fanning sneak
away?" one of the throng asked angrily.</p>

<p>"Not so, my friend. While the Regulators
are under arms you know full well that no one
can leave Hillsborough without our permission.
The cause will not suffer by this delay, and we
shall be in better position to demand that which
you have failed of receiving this day&mdash;justice.
Send your families home, collect your weapons,
and join us who have sworn to drive the oppressors
out of upper Carolina."</p>

<p>If Tryon was in the court-room, as many of
the throng declared, then he had heard every
word spoken by our commander, and I venture
to say he felt ill at ease, for it was plain to be
seen that if the Regulators should be reinforced
by these men who were raising their voices
against the farce of a trial, he stood in great
danger of being made prisoner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>He might use the court-house as a fortification,
and could hold it two or three days, perhaps;
but we would take good care that he did
not send any messengers to Brunswick or Newberne,
and there could be but one ending to the
affair.</p>

<p>The people seemed to understand all this, for
straightway they began to move toward the
river, followed by their families, and in less than
half an hour few save the Regulators remained
around the building.</p>

<p>The soldiers who had been stationed outside
now crowded inside the court-house, never
waiting for orders to move, and we were left
like jailers who are satisfied with holding their
prisoners in closed cells.</p>

<p>Master Hamilton told off a dozen men for
sentinels at each side of the building, and as
many more in the rear, with orders to shoot
down any who attempted to escape from the
windows, while the main portion of our force
remained thirty yards or more from the front
doors.</p>

<p>It looked much as if an attack was to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
made upon the king's representatives despite all
Master Hamilton had said regarding the advisability
of waiting for reflection and concerted
plans.</p>

<p>Our commander remained by himself, midway
between the front rank and the building, as if
expecting that which occurred before we had
been in position five minutes.</p>

<p>Then it was that David Edwards, the governor's
secretary, appeared at one of the windows,
and cried warningly:</p>

<p>"In the name of his excellency, Governor
William Tryon, I bid ye disperse! Those who
remain do so under the pain and penalty of being
adjudged in rebellion against his most
gracious majesty."</p>

<p>"We are in rebellion against tyranny and injustice,"
Master Hamilton replied in a loud
voice which had in it no tone of menace. "It
is our purpose to remain here until the wrong
committed this day has been righted, and he who
ventures out from among you in the meantime
will do so at the expense of his life."</p>

<p>"But this is neither more nor less than armed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
rebellion against the king," Edwards cried as if
suddenly understanding that we were in a position
to enforce our demand.</p>

<p>"I repeat that we are not here against the
king, but to uphold the laws which Tryon and
his minions have trampled in the dust. We
of the Regulators number five hundred men;
within two hours we shall have as many more
in our ranks, and it does not need much calculation
on your part to prove that the power is
with us, as the rebellion against his majesty is
with you."</p>

<p>Master Edwards disappeared, and I was expecting
each moment that the soldiers within
the building would open fire upon us, when my
father appeared at the door, holding up his hand
to attract attention.</p>

<p>"It is William Butler, one of the Regulators!"
Master Hamilton shouted for the benefit of
those who might not have recognized my
father. "Let him come out!"</p>

<p>Our commander advanced to my father's side,
and the two held long converse, after which both
came forward toward our troop.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<p>Then appeared once more at the window,
Master Edwards, who cried out:</p>

<p>"Will you allow that I hold a conference
with you in private?"</p>

<p>"Meaning in your own name, or that of the
governor?" Master Hamilton asked sharply.</p>

<p>"I would bring to you a message from his
excellency."</p>

<p>"You may come," our commander said after
whispering with my father; "but I shall repeat
at my pleasure, to these gentlemen, all which
you may say."</p>

<p>Again the secretary disappeared, to show
himself at the door a moment later, and General
Hamilton remained motionless, forcing
Master Edwards to approach him.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen saluted, exchanged a few
words, and then half a dozen of our leaders
were summoned to what appeared to be a
council of war participated in by representatives
of both armies.</p>

<p>Much time was spent by these gentlemen in
consultation; but, finally, it appeared as if some
plan had been arranged to the satisfaction of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
all. Master Edwards returned to the court-house;
our leaders fell back into line, where we
remained half an hour or more wondering
what was to be the upshot of the matter, when
suddenly Masters James and William Hunter,
and three other citizens who had been held
prisoners, came out of the door.</p>

<p>While one might have counted five we were
held speechless with astonishment, and then
our people began to cheer, for it seemed at the
moment as if we had in fact beaten the governor
in a game of his own making.</p>

<p>Before the shouts died away the command
was given for the sentinels to come in; the
troop was formed in fours, and we rode away,
heading for the encampment on the hill.</p>

<p>Our leaders were grave, probably because
they alone knew at what price this temporary
triumph had been purchased; but the remainder
of the party were wild with joy, for we imagined
ourselves victors.</p>

<p>Before fording the river we were joined by
nearly an hundred mounted men who had
obeyed Master Hamilton's instructions to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
their families home and return armed, and
throughout the night we received accessions to
our force until the Regulators were more than
a thousand strong.</p>

<p>It can well be supposed that all the company
were burning with curiosity to learn more concerning
the bargain which had resulted in the
release of the prisoners; but our commander
gave no sign of being in haste to explain matters.</p>

<p>"The Regulation will meet to-night, and the
whole matter shall be laid before it," he said
gravely when Master Howell, bolder than the
others, ventured to ask for particulars.</p>

<p>Sidney and I, when we were occupying our
old lean-to once more, speculated earnestly as to
what the people had, through Master Hamilton,
promised as the price of the prisoners' release;
but we had made little headway when Master
James Hunter, the deputy, approached our
shelter on his way across the encampment.</p>

<p>After our experience in his company he
seemed rather like a comrade than a mere acquaintance,
and Sidney did not hesitate about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
asking the questions we were so eager to have
answered.</p>

<p>"As yet we have really made no bargain, lads,"
Master Hunter said as he seated himself in a
friendly way near us. "The governor promised,
for the sole purpose of averting bloodshed, so
he declared, to release those of us who were
sentenced to imprisonment and fine, in consideration
of the Regulators returning to camp, and
keeping with them such as might arrive bent
on rebellious acts, until to-morrow morning.
Then, so the secretary stated, some proposal
looking to peace will be made."</p>

<p>"It seems much as if Tryon was backing
down from the high horse he has been riding
in the Carolinas," Sidney said with a laugh.</p>

<p>"He had no choice in this case," Master
Hunter replied. "The Regulators held him
like a rat in a trap, and if a battle had ensued
his own precious body would have been endangered.
My only fear is that he counts, by such
delay, on getting the best of us in some way."</p>

<p>"We shall be stronger to-morrow morning
than we are now," I ventured to suggest. "The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
people are coming in rapidly, and soon we shall
outnumber his force five to one."</p>

<p>"All of which is very true, and because he
must have understood that such would be the
case, I am the more suspicious of his honesty in
this matter."</p>

<p>Then it was I dared ask Master Hunter to
tell us all that had occurred in the court-house,
and he began by saying:</p>

<p>"There is very little to the story, lad, for unless
I'm much mistaken, Tryon, Edwards and
Fanning had the program arranged last night.
When I entered the room the sheriff made me
prisoner without so much as producing a warrant.
Not until late in the forenoon were the
others brought in, and then the story of our
misdeeds was quickly told by men like Sandy
Wells. Our defense was cut down in every way;
we were not allowed to call our witnesses, and
checked when we would have argued our case.
There was no verdict given when the trial closed.
The case of Fanning was called, and of all the
witnesses we had brought, only two were allowed
to give in their testimony. Fanning argued that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
he was forced to charge extortionate fees in
order to gain a livelihood; that it was generally
understood court officers should demand sufficient
to provide them with a fair salary, and
then pleaded guilty as to the indictments so
far as the facts were concerned, but insisted
he was innocent according to the spirit of
the law."</p>

<p>"I suppose <i>he</i> was allowed ample time in
which to argue his case," Sidney interrupted.</p>

<p>"As to that you may be certain; it was only
the witnesses appearing against him who were
admonished not to waste the court's time.
Then we were sentenced, and after ten minutes
or more the judges had agreed that Fanning
should pay seven pence for the crime of extorting
hundreds of pounds from the poor. We would
have been sent into the prison at once but for
the fact of your arrival. It could readily be
seen that Tryon was really alarmed by the cries
of those outside, and when the Regulators arrived
he went into the next room with the
judges, Fanning and Edwards. The rest you
know as well as I. We who sat in the dock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
were ordered to follow the secretary, and, to our
great surprise, were set free."</p>

<p>"Then we are to remain here quietly until tomorrow
morning?" Sidney asked.</p>

<p>"That is the proposition."</p>

<p>"And what will the governor be doing meanwhile?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say. It is possible he has troops
on the way from Brunswick or Newberne, as
Master Husband suggests; but I am not of the
same opinion. He would most certainly have
brought to Hillsborough all the force that could
be raised, before the trial began, for it must be
humiliating to be obliged to make any terms
with us."</p>

<p>"He counts on some treachery I'll be bound!"
Sidney exclaimed, and Master Hunter said with
a sigh:</p>

<p>"I have the same fear, lad. To release us
after we had been sentenced was a harder task
for him than if he had set Husband and my
brother free last week. We shall find that he
can play double, while our people hold so
strictly to the truth that they are not willing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
believe a lickspittle like the governor would
stoop to tell a deliberate lie."</p>

<p>Having said this Master Hunter went on his
way, and we lads could do no more than speculate
upon the probability of our having put
Tryon in such a trap that he would be forced
to deal honestly with us.</p>

<p>Late that evening, when there were not less
than one hundred armed men in the encampment,
the Regulation was called to order, and Master
Hamilton opened the meeting by telling the same
story we two lads had previously heard from
Master Hunter. He concluded by saying:</p>

<p>"Believing that humanity demanded us to
avert bloodshed at any price short of honor, the
officers of the Regulation decided on a truce of
twenty hours in consideration of the freedom
of the prisoners. We ask you to hold the
promise we made as if each of you had personally
given his word to it. To-morrow we shall
have another proposition from the governor, and
then will be the time when we must decide as
to our future course."</p>

<p>Many gentlemen spoke on the same subject,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
all agreeing that we could do no less than adhere
strictly to the promise our commander had given,
and then the meeting was dissolved.</p>

<p>Having had no sleep on the previous night,
I was right glad to crawl into the bed of pine
branches which Sidney and I called our own,
and not until the sun showed his face next morning
did I awaken.</p>

<p>Because a truce had been declared, there was
no need of standing guard, and all our company
enjoyed a full night's rest.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast had been eaten we
lounged around the camp, remaining where we
could overlook the town, and waited for some
word from the governor, speculating meanwhile
as to what proposition it might please him to
make.</p>

<p>Noon came, and no messenger appeared.</p>

<p>At one o'clock my father was sent across the
river to learn why we had not heard from Tryon,
and he returned with a reply that we "would
be well satisfied in a few hours."</p>

<p>This message was given by a servant at
the governor's headquarters; my father had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
seen neither the governor, his secretary, nor
Fanning.</p>

<p>There was no little grumbling because we were
thus kept waiting when the truce was for twenty
hours only; but never a man dreamed of breaking
his word. Such perfidy as that was left for
his excellency, William Tryon, he who claimed
to be the king's honorable representative.</p>

<p>My mother had gone home; she went away the
afternoon previous when the women and children
were asked to leave the vicinity, and as we
waited for that message which was so long delayed,
I was truly thankful she had not remained,
for it came into my mind that there would be
a troublous, rather than a peaceful, ending.</p>

<p>The sun was no more than half an hour high
in the heavens when we saw one who appeared
to be a servant, come out of the governor's house
and walk swiftly toward the ford.</p>

<p>It did not seem possible Tryon would send
other than one of his officers on a mission to the
Regulation, and yet I believed that now was
come the time when we were to hear from his
excellency.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>The man halted at the opposite bank of the
river, unfolded a huge document, and began reading
that which told us to what a depth of infamy
William Tryon was willing to descend in order
to carry his point.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="s08">THE PROCLAMATION.</span></h2>

<p>It can well be understood with what eagerness
we listened to the messenger as he read from
the paper in a loud tone; but he remained at
such a distance that I found it impossible to
catch every word, although the general purport
was made sufficiently plain.</p>

<p>The fellow, whom we afterward came to know
was one of the clerks from the sheriff's office, regaled
us with a high-sounding proclamation from
the governor, in which his excellency graciously
pardoned all the Regulators save thirteen, whose
names were twice repeated in order that there
should be no mistake.</p>

<p>I set them down here that the world may know
who were the patriots of upper Carolina in the
opinion of William Tryon:</p>

<p>"James Hunter, Ninian Bell Hamilton, Peter
Craven, Isaack Jackson, Herman Husband,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Matthew Hamilton, William Payne, Malichi
Tyke, William Moffat, Christopher Nation, Solomon
Goff, John O'Neil, and Rednap Howell."</p>

<p>When the clerk ceased reading and marched
back from whence he came, we on the hillside
looked at each other in silent amazement while
one might have counted twenty, and then on the
instant every tongue was loosened.</p>

<p>All that had been gained by the truce was an
act of outlawry against our best men, and Fanning
was still the trusted servant of the king!</p>

<p>The one thought in the minds of all was to seize
the person of the villain who held a commission
from the crown as governor of the Carolinas, and
a thousand voices were crying out against delay.</p>

<p>The officers of the Regulation held a brief consultation,
and then came that command which all
expected and demanded.</p>

<p>"To horse, gentlemen! The moment has
arrived when we must declare ourselves against
the king, unless he redresses our wrongs by
recalling such officials as have misruled the
colony!" General Hamilton cried in a loud tone,
and he had no more than concluded before every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Regulator was in the saddle burning to avenge
the insult offered by Tryon.</p>

<p>The earth literally trembled beneath the hoofs
of a thousand horses as we rode at full speed
to the ford, then across the river, and on to the
governor's residence.</p>

<p>The royal "army" remained on guard until
we were come to within an hundred yards, and
then they scattered like chaff before the wind,
running in every direction, crying for quarter.</p>

<p>No attention was given to the cowards.
Tryon, Fanning and Edwards were the men we
counted on teaching a lesson, and the dwelling
was surrounded in a twinkling.</p>

<p>Fifty gentlemen entered the building, some of
them to reappear a few moments later with the
fellow who had read the proclamation.</p>

<p>"Tryon! Tryon!" our people shouted in
anger, and then came the truth which, in our
simplicity and honesty, we had not suspected.</p>

<p>"Tryon and his henchmen left town last night
escorted by twenty men!" one of those who
had come out with the prisoner shouted, and we
who heard the words gazed in open-mouthed astonishment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
failing on the instant to understand
that the villainous representative of the king
had simply proposed the truce in order that he
might save his own precious body.</p>

<p>The clerk, fearing for his life, and hoping to
save it by answering the questions which were
literally hurled at him, told the entire story
twenty times over, until we came to realize that
the three rascals had set off at full speed immediately
after sunset on the day previous. By
this time they were half-way to Brunswick, and
however good our steeds, there was no possibility
we could overtake them.</p>

<p>Unless we might hold the governor of the
colony as our prisoner, rebellion would avail us
little, save that we should retain possession of
upper Carolina until such time as he could send
an overwhelming force against us.</p>

<p>There was not a man in the ranks of the
Regulators who did not realize that Tryon had
outwitted us, and that our only hope lay in remaining
together year after year until the other
colonies should be willing to join us in the
struggle for liberty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>And in the meantime, while holding out
against the king, how might we gain means of
subsistence? The richest among us owned only
so much land, and this could not be tilled if we
were forced to fight day after day to retain possession
of a small extent of territory.</p>

<p>When all this was fully understood as we sat
in our saddles near about the governor's house,
I saw this man and that, the bravest among us,
give way to tears, and for the time being it
seemed to me that the cause of liberty was
crushed.</p>

<p>I could not then foresee that in the principal
towns of the eastern colonies would spring up
branches of our association, styled "Sons of
Liberty," who would resist, as we had done, the
unjust demands of an unjust king until the beacon
lights of rebellion were kindled on every hill.
I could not foresee that massacre at Lexington
and at Concord which was needed to arouse
the people until no sacrifice appeared too great,
so that we purchased liberty for those who
should live after us.</p>

<p>In silence, each man hanging his head as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
having suffered an ignominious defeat, instead
of allowing ourselves to be tricked because of
believing that a gentleman's word was sacred,
we returned to the encampment on the hill, and
were there formed in line for what I believed
would be the last time.</p>

<p>There were more than Sidney and myself
who looked as if bowed down with sorrow, and
when we most needed words of encouragement
they came from our commander, that noble old
man who was, by the proclamation of one false
to all the instincts of a gentleman, an outlaw on
whose head a price was shortly to be set.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the Regulation," General
Hamilton began, speaking loud and clear as becomes
an honest man who knows in his heart
that he is in the true path, "we have been deceived,
and are thereby cast down by sorrow.
At a time when it appeared as if we held the
threads which could be woven fairly to the
interests of this colony, we have, by trusting in
the words of one who has no honor in his heart,
lost all our advantage; but we would be proving
ourselves faint-hearted indeed if such a misfortune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
was accepted as final defeat. Now more
than ever, must we struggle against wrong and
oppression. It is not necessary you should
again swear to be true to the cause; neither
will it be of service to remain together just now,
therefore I have this to propose, and it is for
you to decide if it be the proper course: Let
us disperse, each going to his home, there to
remain one month; at the expiration of such
time we will meet at Maddock's Mill to settle
upon a further course of action."</p>

<p>The idea that we should remain as the Regulation,
subject at any time to a call from our
leaders, heartened us wonderfully, and with one
accord our people agreed that Master Hamilton's
plan should be adopted.</p>

<p>We broke ranks, each vowing friendship for
his comrades, and entire devotion to the cause,
and then went our several ways home firmly believing
that in due course of time the purpose
of the Regulation would be accomplished.</p>

<p>And now has come the time when I must
hasten over the months and even years, without
entering into details as to what Sidney or I did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
while we waited an opportunity to strike a
blow for our distressed country.</p>

<p>True to the proposition of Master Hamilton,
we met once each month, either at Maddock's
Mill, or some other place equally central, and
thus kept pace with the events which particularly
concerned us of the Carolinas.</p>

<p>Tryon remained in Newbern in his palace
which had been paid for by money wrung from
a people who at times actually suffered for food,
and flattered himself that he had finally destroyed
the germs of rebellion that had been sowed by
his own tyranny.</p>

<p>Contrary to our expectations, he did not make
any decided effort to get into his clutches those
of the Regulation whom he had declared outlaws,
and it was quite as well that he remained
quiet on that score, for a thousand of the
king's soldiers could not have taken them from
us.</p>

<p>The sheriffs of the counties in the upper Carolinas,
knowing full well that the Regulation
was neither crushed nor disheartened, no longer
attempted to collect the unjust taxes, and thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
it was that our people had been benefited in
some slight degree.</p>

<p>We cultivated our lands, moved about at will
without fear of being molested during nearly
two years, and then, on a certain day in September,
Sidney came to my home in hot haste,
acting as messenger of the Regulation.</p>

<p>Word had come from Newbern that the Superior
Court was to be convened on the 24th day
of the month, and then would efforts be made
to secure the bodies of those whom Tryon had
styled "outlaws."</p>

<p>Master Hamilton, who yet remained in command
of the Regulators, despite his many years,
had decided that our wisest method of procedure
was to interfere at the outset, claiming that we
had the right to make certain that justice, not
the will of Governor Tryon, should influence the
decisions given by judges who were inclined to
listen to the orders of the governor rather than
the evidence before them.</p>

<p>It can well be supposed that neither my
father nor myself lost any time in saddling our
horses, and within twenty-four hours we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
at the old encampment which overlooked the
town of Hillsborough.</p>

<p>This time we were perfect masters of the situation.
Tryon, believing the Regulation had been
crushed out of existence, neglected to send
soldiers to overawe us, and twenty of our people
took possession of the court-house, while the
remainder occupied the hill on the opposite side
of the river ready to cross whenever a signal
should be given that the services of armed men
were necessary.</p>

<p>Because of our superior numbers, there was
little chance the king's minions could do very
much harm, therefore we were not held to rigid
military discipline, and Sidney Hubbard and
myself had no difficulty in obtaining permission
to accompany that party which was to make
certain no wrongs were inflicted upon us in the
name of the law.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the court-house, having
left our horses on the opposite side of the river,
we found there but one judge, and he the man
above all others who was ready to give such
verdicts as would please the governor. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
needless for me to set down the fact that this
man was Richard Henderson.</p>

<p>Seeing our party enter the building Fanning
took it upon himself to ask that we be put
out, and not allowed to enter even the yard, because,
as he said, there were outlaws among us
who had come for no other purpose than to
create a disturbance.</p>

<p>All those of whom he thus spoke had suffered
many wrongs at the hands of this same attorney,
and foremost in the list of the oppressed were
Herman Husband, the two Hunters, and Rednap
Howell, not one of whom felt inclined to
take additional abuse from such a traitor as
Fanning.</p>

<p>That they acted hastily in the matter, I must
admit; but at the same time one should remember
the wrongs they had received. The miserable
cur of an attorney had no sooner ceased
speaking than the gentlemen I have named,
aided by all the Regulators present, seized Fanning
roughly and literally dragged him into
the courtyard, where Sidney and I were set
over him as guards until such time as our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
people might be at liberty to attend to him
properly.</p>

<p>Because of being thus occupied, I did not see
that which followed; but later in the day my
comrade and I were told that our people demanded
the trial of those belonging to the Regulation
who had been declared outlaws, which
was no more than just, since the court had been
called together for that sole purpose.</p>

<p>It was not the purpose of Judge Henderson
to give the Regulators a fair trial, and, therefore,
in order to outwit us, he declared the court
adjourned for the day.</p>

<p>Then he left the building, walking swiftly
through the yard as if expecting to be roughly
treated, and once he was out of sight our party
set about giving Fanning a lesson.</p>

<p>He was taken across the river to our encampment,
being dragged by the heels a portion of
the way, and there we held a little court of our
own, the decisions of which I dare venture to
say were more in accordance with strict justice
than any Judge Richardson would have delivered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<p>It was decided that Fanning should be beaten
with rods in the presence of the Regulation, and
Masters Husband and James Hunter were the
gentlemen selected to inflict the punishment,
therefore it can well be fancied that it was done
in proper fashion.</p>

<p>We kept the attorney with us during the
night, and next morning all our company rode
over to Hillsborough, only to find that the
brave judge had run away during the night,
after declaring that the court was adjourned
until one year from that day. He could not
pronounce the sentences which Tryon demanded,
therefore had no idea of being forced to act
honestly for once in his life.</p>

<p>Well, some of the hotter heads, taking advantage
of the general confusion, utterly destroyed
Fanning's house, beating him again before setting
the scoundrel at liberty.</p>

<p>This done we went home once more, agreeing
to meet each month as before.</p>

<p>I can best tell the remainder of my story, up
to the time when Governor Tryon decided to
wage war upon us, by quoting from a history
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
of the Carolinas which I have lately seen; and
while it is written from the standpoint of the
royalists, it is correct as to the acts and movements
of our enemy:
<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>

"Judge Henderson, who was driven from
the bench, called upon Tryon to restore order in
his district. The governor perceived that a
temporizing policy would no longer be expedient,
and resolved to employ the military force
to subdue the rebellious spirit of the Regulators.
He deferred operations, however, until the meeting
of the Legislature, in December.</p>

<p>"Herman Husband was a member of the
Lower House, from Orange, and there were
others in that body who sympathized with the
oppressed people. Various measures were proposed
to weaken the strength of the Regulators;
and among others, four new counties were
formed of portions of Orange, Cumberland, and
Johnson. These counties were named Guilford,
Chatham, Wake and Surrey. Finally, when the
Legislature was about to adjourn without
authorizing a military expedition, information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
came that the Regulators had assembled at
Cross Creek, with the intention of marching
upon Newbern, having heard that Husband had
been imprisoned."</p>

<p>Now at this point I must interrupt the historian
in order to explain that we of the Regulation
did indeed make this march. We knew
full well that Tryon both hated and feared
Herman Husband, and, therefore, kept one or
more of our people in Newbern all the time the
Legislature was assembled in order that the news,
if there was any of importance, might be sent
without loss of time to our leaders.</p>

<p>It is a fact that Tryon even went so far as
to prefer charges against Master Husband, and
that the council caused his arrest and imprisonment.
Word to this effect was brought to us at
once, and we set out for Cross Creek; but Governor
Tryon had his spies out, and when it was
known that the Regulators, a thousand strong,
were riding to aid one of their number who was
illegally deprived of his liberty, the council
made haste to examine the charges against Master
Husband.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>They finally decided, in order to save their
own worthless skins, that the charges were not
sustained, and set the prisoner at liberty, imploring
him to ride with all speed in order to prevent
us from entering Newbern.</p>

<p>He met us at Cross Creek, and we escorted
him home; but this time it was decided that the
Regulation go into camp at Maddock's Mill, and
there remain ready for war until it was learned
how far our enemy proposed to go in his effort
to exterminate us, for that was what he had
boldly said he would do. Now we will copy
once more from the printed story of our struggle:</p>

<p>"The Assembly immediately voted two thousand
dollars for the use of the governor. The
alarmed chief magistrate fortified his palace, and
placed the town in a state of defense. He also
issued a proclamation, and orders to the colonels
of the counties in the vicinity, to have the militia
in readiness. These precautions were unnecessary,
for the Regulators, after crossing the Haw,
a few miles above Pittsborough, to the number
of more than one thousand, met Husband on his
way home, and retraced their steps.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<p>"The governor soon issued another proclamation,
prohibiting the sale of powder, shot, or
lead, until further notice. This was to prevent
the Regulators supplying themselves with munitions
of war. This measure added fuel to the
flame of excitement, and finally, the governor
becoming again alarmed, he made a virtual declaration
of war, through his council. That
body authorized him to raise a sufficient force
to march into the rebellious districts and establish
law and order.</p>

<p>"The governor issued a circular to the colonels,
ordering them to select fifty volunteers
from their respective regiments and send them to
Newbern. With about three hundred militiamen,
a small train of artillery, some baggage
wagons, and several personal friends, Tryon left
Newbern on the 24th of April. On the 4th of
May he encamped on the Eno, having been reinforced
by detachments on the way. General
Hugh Waddel was directed to collect the forces
from the western counties, rendezvous at Salisbury,
and join the governor in Orange County."</p>

<p>It goes without saying that while these preparations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
were being made, whereby Tryon
counted on driving us from the face of the
earth, our spies were scattered around the country
plentifully, and, therefore, we knew exactly
the size of his force, and how it was made up,
when he went into camp.</p>

<p>Colonel Joseph Leech commanded the infantry,
Captain Moore the artillery, and Captain
Neale a company of rangers. On his way to
the Eno Tryon was joined by a detachment from
Hanover, under Colonel John Ashe; another
from Carteret, under Colonel Craig; another
from Johnston, under Colonel William Thompson;
another from Beaufort, under Colonel
Needham Bryan; another from Wake, under
Colonel Johnson Hinton; and at his camp on
the Eno he was joined by Fanning, with a corps
of clerks, constables, sheriffs and others.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="s08">WAR DECLARED.</span></h2>

<p>At last the Regulation had forced Governor
Tryon to acknowledge it as an adversary, and
this afforded the members no slight amount of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Until he marched out of Newbern with the
militia, it had been his good pleasure to treat us
as a lot of malcontents who should be dealt with
by constables or sheriffs, and in his proclamations,
or statements made to the people of other
colonies, he was careful to so word his communications
as to make it appear that the people of
the upper Carolinas, instead of being banded together
for a specific purpose, were simply rioting
and plundering.</p>

<p>And I doubt not but that many of the colonists
considered us a gang of bullies who had
set their faces against law and order, never
understanding that ours was a purpose which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
lay close to the heart of every true citizen, until
that day came when he marched out against
us.</p>

<p>We, the Regulators, were encamped on
William Payne's plantation when the news
came that our enemy had left Newbern after
giving orders that he be joined on the route to
the Eno by this force or that, and Master Rednap
Howell said gleefully as he heard of that movement
which might result in the death of many
of our company:</p>

<p>"It is the first cheering news we have had
brought to us during the past two years. Now
must it be known in the other colonies that we
are standing up for liberty, and, instead of believing
us to be a few hot-heads, the people will
understand that our party is a strong one, otherwise
there would be no need for the governor
to come out with such a force."</p>

<p>And Master Butler added:</p>

<p>"Tryon must fight this time, instead of sitting
in his palace and ordering that this or that
gentleman be thrown into prison. We have
more than half attained our end when the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
colonies understand for what principle we are
holding out."</p>

<p>In fact, this move of Tryon's caused the
greatest possible satisfaction among our people,
who had been running hither and thither for
the past two years without opportunity of making
public the oppression against which they
had risen in arms. Never a member of our
party who questioned as to what our leaders
would do; it was to all of us a settled fact that
we would meet the government as speedily as
might be, and in anticipation of the command
we began furbishing up our equipments,
or looking after the horses to make
certain they were in condition for a forced
march.</p>

<p>By this time Sidney and I were eighteen
years of age, and no longer considered ourselves
boys. Since having been permitted to join the
Regulation we had been credited with doing
good work, never flinching from a severe task
or holding back because of danger, and thus we
rode with the company as equals.</p>

<p>I believe we two lads were more eager than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
any of our companions to meet Tryon's forces in
the open field; for it was our firm belief that
the Regulators would win the first battle
fought and we burned with impatience to show
what we could do as soldiers.</p>

<p>"I never felt well inclined toward Governor
Tryon until this moment," Sidney said in a
matter-of-fact tone as we overhauled our saddle-girths
to make certain they were in good condition.
"Now it is very much as if he had suddenly
become our friend, because of having
boldly taken the field against us."</p>

<p>"According to the report of our scouts, he
must outnumber us two to one," I ventured to
suggest.</p>

<p>"The result will be the same if four against
one is the odds. We must win, and what a
relief it will be to ride forward with a definite
aim, instead of going here and there without
effecting anything, as we have been doing these
two years past."</p>

<p>"I agree with you on the last, Sidney; but
holding our own against twice our force is a
different matter."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<p>The lad looked at me scrutinizingly for an
instant, and then asked banteringly:</p>

<p>"Are you beginning to show the white feather
just when our affairs look the most promising,
Clare?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," I replied indignantly. "To
my mind it is no evidence of cowardice to count
well the situation and strength of the enemy."</p>

<p>"But you went farther, and was near to
questioning whether Tryon's force might not
worst us, simply because of its size."</p>

<p>"And why might I not question it? A full
thousand of his men are citizens of the Carolinas,
and should be our equals in both riding and
fighting."</p>

<p>"So they would were the cause the same; but
they fight on the side of oppression, while we
are striving to do that which shall be of benefit
to every person in the American colonies."</p>

<p>I did not attempt to continue what was rapidly
becoming an argument, simply because it
was useless just then. I believed it was folly
to claim that gentlemen of the Carolinas who
did not hold to our opinions were our inferiors:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
but knew full well that it would be impossible
to persuade my comrade to look at the matter
in the same light I did.</p>

<p>It is a sad mistake to think that ourselves
and our adherents are better men than those
who oppose us, and that, I think, has been fully
proven by this time.</p>

<p>I was ready to say that our cause was just,
while theirs was not, and further than such a
statement I would not go.</p>

<p>Finding that I was not inclined for a wordy
quarrel, Sidney ceased boasting of what the
Regulators could do, and set about speculating
as to whether Tryon would remain on the Eno
until we could come up with him, until suddenly,
at the moment our people were least expecting
it, word was passed through the camp that
we were to fall into line, unmounted, to hear an
important announcement from the commander.</p>

<p>"I wish we had been summoned to appear
ready for marching," my comrade said almost
petulantly as he made his preparations for obeying
by washing his hands, which were covered
with the grease he had been applying to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
bridle. "This talk of an 'announcement' has in
it a suspicion that the Regulators are not to
break camp immediately."</p>

<p>"Don't begin to look after trouble," I replied
with a laugh, knowing well Sidney's disposition.
"If we do not set out this night, the Regulators
will take the road to-morrow, and I'll warrant
we see Tryon's soldiers in good time."</p>

<p>There were many others besides Sidney who
felt a certain degree of irritation because we
were to hear words, instead of commands which
would result in setting the entire company in
motion toward the enemy; but all of us soon
learned that Master Hamilton had no idea of
trying to evade a pitched battle.</p>

<p>"Since this association was formed, it has
been the custom to discuss any important movement
with all the company, therefore have you
been summoned," our commander said when we
had been formed in a hollow square with him
in our midst. "It is not necessary for me to
promise that you shall be led against the enemy
at the earliest fitting moment, and I also declare
that you shall not be allowed to hurl yourselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
upon the government troops like an unruly
mob. When we have made ready, Governor
Tryon shall see us. Our scouts have brought
in the information that General Waddel is
halted with a small force at Salisbury, awaiting
the arrival of powder from Charleston. The
Regulators need that powder, and I propose
that we take it. Two hundred men well
mounted will be sufficient for the enterprise,
and in order that there shall be no charge of
favoritism made against me, instead of detailing
a force of such size, I ask that the best mounted
among you step three paces to the rear, in token
that you are willing to make the venture."</p>

<p>The old gentleman had hardly more than
ceased speaking when the entire company
moved back as if with one accord, thus showing
that every man of us was eager for active service,
and that each one believed his horse superior
to all the others.</p>

<p>Master Hamilton laughed heartily, and then
asked that none but the youngest volunteer for
the service, and do so by stepping forward into
the former position.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>Once more was the square formed in the
first position, for not a man was willing to be
left behind at such a time.</p>

<p>It was positive that all the company could
not be spared for a service which might be performed
by two hundred men, and I wondered
how the matter could be arranged without
causing jealousy.</p>

<p>Then our commander explained that it
would be unwise to go for the powder with
such a large company, and announced that
since we could not settle the matter among
ourselves, he would be forced to decide for
us.</p>

<p>"We will begin with William Husband and
count from one to five in regular order," he said
at length. "Every fifth man is to fall out of
line and make immediate preparations for a
forced march."</p>

<p>Sidney was standing by my side, and, fearing
lest one should be taken and the other left, I
whispered hurriedly to him:</p>

<p>"Move up until you are the fifth from me,
and then if one goes the other will be with him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
I would be as sad to leave you behind, as you
would to see me stay in case you drew the lucky
number."</p>

<p>He agreed at once, for Sidney was a true
comrade in every sense of the word, and hardly
had he taken up a new position when Master
Husband began the count.</p>

<p>My breath came thick and fast as the numbers
sounded nearer and nearer, so fearful was I lest
the number should doom me to stay in camp
when glory might be earned, and I had so
worked myself into a fever that when the man
standing next beside me spoke the word "four,"
it was almost impossible for me to add the next
number.</p>

<p>I fell out of line silently, and one of those
who had been selected to remain behind, thinking
I was afraid to venture on the enterprise,
whispered eagerly:</p>

<p>"I'll swap my new saddle for your old one,
if you'll give me your chance."</p>

<p>"I'd not consent if you threw into the bargain
the best horse in the company," I replied,
and an instant later Sidney and I were shaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
hands vigorously in token of delight because of
our good fortune.</p>

<p>It can well be supposed that we were not
many moments making ready for the expedition,
and when we came to the center of the encampment,
where the lucky ones were assembling, it
was learned that Master Rednap Howell had
been selected as the leader of our party.</p>

<p>The only orders Master Hamilton had to
give were announced in the hearing of all. We
were to ride toward Salisbury until arriving at
the bank of the Yadkin, which river was to be
crossed in order that we might come upon General
Waddel from Cabarras County, thus hoping
to give him the impression that the Regulators
were south of him, instead of in the course taken
up by Tryon.</p>

<p>Master Hamilton was good enough to explain
that he believed beyond a peradventure we
would soon fight with the governor's forces;
but it was his hope that we might meet them
elsewhere than near about our own homes.</p>

<p>A ride of between eighty and ninety miles
was before us; but we gave little heed to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
distance, since each yard traversed brought us
so much nearer the enemy, and I venture to say
that a more eager, happy party of men never set
out to provoke a battle.</p>

<p>When I say that the Regulators were in sore
need of powder, it can be understood that this
venture of ours meant more than the worrying
of General Waddel; we were depending upon
him for ammunition with which to wage battle
against Tryon.</p>

<p>In less than an hour from the time when we
had been summoned to hear Master Hamilton's
announcement, our company of two hundred
were riding away from the encampment, envied
by every man who was forced to remain behind.</p>

<p>Many a time since Governor Tryon gave us
the slip at Hillsborough had we ridden across
the country in company; but never before with
the certainty before us that we might measure
strength with the oppressors of the colony if it
so pleased us, and this fact it was which put us
in such wondrous spirits.</p>

<p>It was the first opportunity we had had of
striking a blow, and we were determined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
give a good account of ourselves, regardless of
the numbers to which we might find ourselves
opposed.</p>

<p>We rode at an easy pace, believing there
was no urgent need for haste; but did not draw
rein until sunset, when Master Howell gave the
word to halt and unsaddle.</p>

<p>"There is plenty of water and grass here,"
he said in explanation, "and the animals need
a rest, not having the same spur to exertion as
was given us with the news that Waddel might
be where we could get at him."</p>

<p>Each man carried his share of the provisions,
and as soon as the horses had been cared for,
we ate a hearty supper, knowing that many
hours might elapse before another opportunity
for satisfying hunger presented itself.</p>

<p>At the end of two hours we were in the
saddle again, and we rode until near two o'clock
in the morning, with but one short halt, when
the company had arrived at the bank of the
Yadkin.</p>

<p>Now was come the time when scouts should
be sent out lest we come upon the enemy before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
gaining possession of the powder, and it was
near daybreak before the march was resumed.</p>

<p>By that time we had learned that General
Waddel's force was in Salisbury, and counting
on remaining there until the ammunition train
came up.</p>

<p>Two miles below was a ford where we might
cross the river without swimming the horses,
and when the sun showed himself we were
headed at full speed for the road leading from
Charlotte to Salisbury, over which it had been
reported that the powder would be sent.</p>

<p>Our horses were well blown; but we had
made good time, and the only thing which
might prevent the venture from being a success,
was that General Waddel had already received
the ammunition.</p>

<p>"If it turns out that we are too late to intercept
the convoy, we must try conclusions with
Waddel," one of our party said when we were
waiting on the west side of the river for our
people to get into line, and, overhearing the
remark, Master Howell said emphatically:</p>

<p>"Don't fear that we'll miss of getting our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
hands on the powder. We'll have a try for it
even though it becomes necessary to face all the
men Tryon has brought with him."</p>

<p>But that we were in an enemy's country our
people would have cheered this statement; but
as it was the men contented themselves with
raising their hats to such a leader, and then
we rode on, now intent only on finding a hiding-place
where we might remain until scouts
had been sent out to learn the condition of
affairs.</p>

<p>Eager though Sidney and I were to come
face to face with those who wore the king's
uniform, both were well pleased when the word
was given to halt and make camp under cover.
We had ridden nearly four and twenty hours,
and although our hearts were stout for a battle,
our bodies were sadly in need of a rest.</p>

<p>We had halted by the side of the road between
Charlotte and Salisbury, along which the
powder must pass if it had not done so already,
and on either side the highway were groves of
live oak where five hundred men and horses
might readily have found a hiding-place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<p>Five were told off as sentinels to give the
alarm when the ammunition train came in sight,
and five more were detailed to scout in the
direction of Charlotte to make certain the
powder was yet to the south of our hiding-place.</p>

<p>Neither Sidney nor I envied those who were
obliged to remain in the saddle yet longer. If,
four and twenty hours previous, there had been
an opportunity to act as scouts, we two lads
would have been willing to fight for the honor;
but now we congratulated each other on the
possibility of gaining a little sleep before the
battle was begun.</p>

<p>We tethered our horses near by; placed saddles
and bridles where they might be come at in
a hurry, and laid ourselves down in a thicket of
small oaks, falling asleep almost as soon as we
touched the ground.</p>

<p>It was sunset when I awakened, and looked
about me fearing, by some unlucky chance, the
company had got away without my knowledge;
but my mind was soon set at rest by seeing
a score or more of men lounging near at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
hand as if discussing some matter of importance.</p>

<p>Without stopping to awaken Sidney, I went
toward them, and soon learned that our journey
had not been in vain. The scouts had come in
with the report that the powder and its convoy
had not yet arrived at Charlotte, therefore we
had only to wait patiently for the desired opportunity.</p>

<p>I was also told that Master Howell had stationed
guards three miles down the road, in
order that we might have timely warning of the
movements of the train, and there was nothing
for us to do but pass the time as best we might,
providing all hands were ready for a quick
jump at the word of command.</p>

<p>When we first halted I was so sore in body
from long riding that I believed four and twenty
hours of a rest would not be sufficient to satisfy
me; but within half an hour after awakening
and being told that there was no doubt as to
the coming of our game, I was eager to be in
the saddle once more.</p>

<p>Although our sentinels were four miles away,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
and would come into camp at their best pace
on hearing or seeing the ammunition train, the
word was passed that no man should speak
above a whisper, while the horses were to be
guarded closely lest by whinnying they betray
our whereabouts.</p>

<p>Then came a most trying time of waiting,
when we crouched in the darkness close by our
accouterments that there might be no delay in
laying hands on them immediately the alarm
was given, and expecting each instant to be
engaged in deadly conflict.</p>

<p>Sidney and I were side by side, not making
any attempt to start a conversation because our
nerves were strung too tightly to admit of anything
like ordinary topics, and I do not remember
of passing such dreary, dismal moments.</p>

<p>One had ample time in which to figure all
the chances in favor of his being killed or
wounded, and to speculate upon the probabilities
of success. It seemed as if each moment
was ten times its usual length, while the hours
were like entire days.</p>

<p>Once when I believed it must be near morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
and was looking up at the sky for the first
faint light of the coming dawn, I heard Master
Howell say that it yet lacked a quarter of an
hour to being midnight, and then both patience
and courage oozed out at my finger ends. The
cold chill of fear ran up and down my spine,
and I believe that had the enemy made his appearance
just at that moment, I should have
been forced to fight against an inclination to
run away.</p>

<p>It is needless and impossible to try to give
any correct story as to that night when we
waited for the enemy, fearing because success
was so necessary to our cause, that, by some
blunder or unforeseen accident, we might fail.</p>

<p>The sun had risen, showing haggard faces
amid that thicket of live oaks, when we heard
among the underbrush some distance away, that
crashing which tells of a heavy body trying to
force its way through the foliage.</p>

<p>Every man of us sprang to his feet and held
his horse's bridle ready, when we saw one of
the scouts in company with a sentinel.</p>

<p>"The train will be here within an hour!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
was the whisper, and even though the time when
we might meet the foe was so far in the future,
I ran with all speed to saddle my steed, exulting
and at the same moment timorous.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="s08">THE CONVOY.</span></h2>

<p>After the first flush of excitement had died
away, leaving in its stead that tremulous calm
which is caused by exceeding great courage or
abject fear, we of the Regulation went about
our task in proper order and with due precaution.</p>

<p>It was Sidney who, when I was exultant and
excited to the verge of doing some foolish thing,
brought me to a realization of the situation by
saying scornfully:</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to grow ashamed of the Regulators.
To see them running around here as if
bereft of reason simply because a rascally corporal's
guard of a convoy is coming this way,
one would say they had never seen service. Is
there like to be so much of credit in the capture
of ten or twenty men by a force of two hundred,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
that each fellow burns with a desire to be
in the front rank?"</p>

<p>For a moment I was ashamed at having
shown so much emotion over what was really
nothing more than an incident, and then there
came to my mind the knowledge that this capture
meant more to us of the Regulation than
would the taking of a force twice our size, and
I said decidedly, angry with myself for having
been disconcerted by Sidney's scorn:</p>

<p>"One whose heart is with the cause cannot
fail of being excited and anxious at such
a time, no matter how small may be the
force with which we are to contend. It is the
idea that the powder is sadly needed by our
people, which causes our company to be unduly
excited. Every man realizes the importance of
doing the task well, and, quite naturally, fears
lest it be not performed thoroughly."</p>

<p>Sidney had no reply to make, and I fancy he
was somewhat ashamed of having spoken disparagingly
of his companions.</p>

<p>Then the word was passed in a whisper for
each man to conceal himself and his horse as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
near the edge of the road as possible, remaining
there in readiness to spring out at the first word
of command.</p>

<p>A squad of ten was sent a quarter of a mile
to the north in order to intercept any who might
succeed in making their way past the main body,
and our preparations were complete.</p>

<p>I understood that the word for the attack
would not be given until the convoy was
opposite the center of our line, so that we might
completely encircle it to prevent escape in
either direction.</p>

<p>Then came half an hour of suppressed excitement,
during which I could distinctly hear the
beating of my own heart, and finally, the rumble
of wheels in the distance, proclaiming the near
approach of our prey.</p>

<p>The train consisted of two heavily laden
carts convoyed by twenty men, as I could see
when the force was nearly opposite my hiding-place,
and these details had no more than been
noted when Master Howell's voice rang out like
a trumpet:</p>

<p>"At them, lads! At them, and make certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
none escape you!" To those we were about
to attack it must have seemed as if the thicket
itself suddenly sprang out toward them, and
before they had time to draw up in line ready
to receive us, the party was completely surrounded.</p>

<p>I would have been ashamed had there been
no show of resistance, for the convoy was made
up of Carolinians, and, whether they were for
the king or the people, it behooved them to
display courage.</p>

<p>At the word we could have shot all the
little company down, most likely at the first
volley, and in order to save bloodshed Master
Howell cried sharply:</p>

<p>"Surrender, you of the convoy! We are full
two hundred strong, and there is no good reason
why you should throw away your lives!"</p>

<p>While one might have counted ten a deep
silence, save for the pawing or stamping of the
horses, fell upon all that gathering in the road,
and then the leader of the convoy, having seen
that there was no hope of accomplishing anything
by resistance, said curtly:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<p>"We can do no less than obey your order to
surrender."</p>

<p>"Lay your arms on the wagons, after having
dismounted, and then march toward the
south."</p>

<p>No one spoke while this command was
being obeyed until, the men having marched
down the road a dozen yards or more from the
hindermost wagon, Master Howell called upon
them to halt.</p>

<p>Then ten men were told off with orders to
guard the prisoners, and when this squad had
taken position near the convoy, our leader said
in the tone of one who has already mapped out
his course of action:</p>

<p>"You will march your squad well to the
westward of Salisbury, and endeavor to gain
our headquarters. Do not take any chances of
coming in contact with Waddel's force, and see
to it that not a man escapes. You may set off
at once, gentlemen."</p>

<p>The prisoners were first searched to make
certain they had no weapons concealed about
them, and then the little party rode slowly up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
toward Salisbury counting on striking into
the thicket before coming within dangerous
distance of the town.</p>

<p>When the party had disappeared in the
distance, we set about taking possession of the
ammunition.</p>

<p>As a matter of course it was impossible for
us to take the wagons with us, therefore
each man was ordered to carry such portion of
the powder as he could strap to his saddle, and
we set about the work, the greater number of
us stripping off our outer shirts, which we
converted into bags by tying up the neck and
sleeves.</p>

<p>So great was the supply that even when each
trooper had all he could conveniently carry,
there yet remained a full third of the whole,
and this we proceeded to destroy by pouring it
into the tiny creek which bordered the western
side of the road. Then the horses were unharnessed
and set free from the carts, which we
left where they were in the highway, and our
company formed in line once more.</p>

<p>I had supposed that we would be ordered to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
join the main body of Regulators; but in this
I speedily found myself mistaken, for we rode
directly to the Yadkin River, and crossed it,
going immediately into camp in a grove of live
oaks.</p>

<p>Once this had been done Master Howell sent
off five men as scouts, and soon we came to
know that this last detachment was gone to spy
upon General Waddel's force.</p>

<p>"Yes," our leader said decidedly in reply to a
question from one of the older men, "I count
on attacking the force which is now at Salisbury.
It would be little less than criminal to let
slip such an opportunity as is now before us.
Waddel is short of ammunition, now we have
captured his supply, and I'm of the opinion that
he will make an effort to join Tryon, in which
case we have him at our mercy. It will not
cause us more than two days in time, and we
shall be doing great service by preventing the
union of the forces."</p>

<p>Now indeed were we doing something in aid
of the cause, and my heart leaped high with
joy, for it was reasonable to suppose that, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
case our leader accomplished all he had set himself,
the main body of the Regulators could
readily take care of Governor Tryon's army.</p>

<p>It was at this time, although we did not come
to know of it until after several days, that
Master Rednap Howell showed himself to be a
great leader, inasmuch as he caused to be conveyed
to General Waddel, without trouble or
inconvenience to ourselves, that information
which we desired him to have, and the task was
performed in this fashion:</p>

<p>Those who had in charge the captured convoy
were instructed to allow one of them to escape,
after the party were so far north of Salisbury
that there would be little likelihood of pursuit,
and then it was certain the fugitive would take
refuge with Waddel's force.</p>

<p>All this was done in accordance with Master
Howell's orders, and thus it came about that
when we were on the easterly bank of the
Yadkin, the general came to the conclusion that
his wisest course would be to join Tryon with
the least possible delay, regardless of the fact
that the powder had been lost.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>Within twelve hours after we had made a
camp in ambush, one of our spies came hot foot
from Salisbury with the word that the king's
forces at that town were making ready for the
march. In addition to this information we
learned considerably to our surprise, that Waddel's
men were in a state of disorder nearly
approaching mutiny. With but few exceptions
they were members of the militia, and openly
avowed that they would not fight under any
consideration; others were favorably inclined
toward the Regulation, and already had many
deserted.</p>

<p>We were unprepared for such good news;
but it did not require much reflection for Master
Howell to hit upon a course of action which
promised success.</p>

<p>Without delay two of our party, the eldest
among us, were sent with all speed under a
flag of truce for an interview with the general.
They were instructed to warn the commander
to remain where he was, or retreat to the coast,
as might best please him, otherwise we would at
once engage him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<p>It was only natural Waddel should believe
that the entire force of Regulators was within
striking distance, and while his men were so
sadly disorganized he could not well risk an
encounter.</p>

<p>We remained in hiding, ready to mount at a
moment's notice, and before our messengers
returned one of the scouts came in with the
word that the militia was crossing the river,
evidently bent on making at least one effort to
join Tryon.</p>

<p>Five minutes after this information was
received we were riding out of the thicket
toward that road which it would be necessary
for the general to take if he counted on meeting
the governor, and within two hours we were
in advance of the king's poor soldiers, ready and
eager for an engagement.</p>

<p>It was only natural that Sidney and I should
be among those who most desired to be led
against the enemy, for now, the first time in two
years, might we add to whatsoever good reputation
we had made as Regulators, and we put
aside the possible danger in the belief that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
we would succeed in distinguishing ourselves.</p>

<p>Skirmishers were sent out to learn when the
enemy approached, and the remainder of us
waited in anxious expectancy the moment
when we might come face to face with the
foe.</p>

<p>In this we were doomed to disappointment,
however.</p>

<p>Waddel also had skirmishers in advance, and
immediately his men came in touch with ours
they retreated, and soon word was brought that
the entire force was retreating across the river
again.</p>

<p>Now began a chase, when our horses were
fresh, but handicapped considerably by the
loads of powder they carried, and we were positive
success would be ours whenever we could
come within range of the foe.</p>

<p>All evidence of military formation was lost
sight of as we forded or swam our horses across
the river, and in less than half an hour we were
among the rear guard; but even this did not
satisfy Master Howell. He believed the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
had come when we might make prisoners of the
entire force, and panted for the glory of capturing
General Waddel himself.</p>

<p>To effect this fifty of us whose horses were
fleetest, and among the number Sidney and I,
were directed to make a detour across the
country in order to strike the enemy in front
before he could gain shelter in Salisbury, holding
him there at whatsoever cost until the force
was absolutely surrounded.</p>

<p>How we rode that day! The horses were
sent forward at racing speed, regardless of the
danger that they might be foundered by carrying
such a weight, and Sidney and I were among
the foremost when we broke cover directly in
advance of the retreating column.</p>

<p>"Look after the general!" Sidney shouted
as we pressed on, our horses running neck and
neck. "Now has come the time when we can
make names for ourselves which will not soon
be forgotten!"</p>

<p>We could see the leader and his officers
plainly, and rode directly toward them without
taking heed as to whether we were followed;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
but there yet remained a sufficient number of
the men who were loyal to the king to prevent
us from carrying out the plan.</p>

<p>We speedily found ourselves confronted by a
squad of twenty or more who stood bravely in
line while their officers rode swiftly away, and
this little party must be attended to before it
might be safe to push on in pursuit of the
prize.</p>

<p>We drew back within the shelter of a clump
of trees, where we were joined by a dozen or
more of our men, and then began the first real
fight in which I ever took part.</p>

<p>There was no room in my mind for fear. I
thought only of what might be done if we could
disperse the party, and I fired and reloaded
without realizing that my one desire was to
take human lives.</p>

<p>The militia held their ground well, and both
sides were at a disadvantage because of trying
to take aim while in the saddle. With such
marksmen as we had among us that squad of
the king's men should all have been disabled
within ten minutes, and yet half an hour passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
without any perceptible advantage on either
side.</p>

<p>Three of our men were down, and four of
theirs had dismounted or been knocked out of
the saddle; but by such time the general and
his officers had surely succeeded in making good
their escape.</p>

<p>From the sounds of firing which came from
every direction we knew full well that all our
party was engaged, and the question had just
come into my mind as to whether this force of
Waddel's had been as badly demoralized as we
were led to believe, when I heard shouts in the
rear, and a moment later saw Master Howell
ride up with eight or ten men at his back.</p>

<p>"Throw down your arms, and surrender!"
he cried to our adversaries. "The remainder
of the command have yielded, and you can do
Tryon no good by holding out longer!"</p>

<p>In a twinkling the men came forward empty-handed,
and the fight was won; but I failed to
feel any great elation because of what we had
lost, while Sidney was furious with rage.</p>

<p>"But for their holding out, we two might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
have captured Waddel with, perhaps, some of
his officers. It is a clear case of cheating, and
we have got the worst of it!"</p>

<p>"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth," I
cried laughingly, for my sorrow was dissipated
by Sidney's rage. "We never counted very
surely on capturing the general, and should
thank our lucky stars that we have deprived
him of his force, for thus have we weakened
Tryon."</p>

<p>He would not be consoled for the lost opportunity
of distinguishing himself, and for a
moment I really believed he was on the point
of striking the disarmed men who had baffled
his desires.</p>

<p>There was no reason why we should not feel
proud of our work. We had captured the ammunition,
which was the first task set us, and,
in addition held as prisoners a force which
Governor Tryon counted on as adding to his
own. Surely we had done well, and if the remainder
of the Regulators could do as much,
then was it certain Tryon would be driven in
shame from this portion of the colony.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<p>Now it was that we had more prisoners than
were convenient. As a matter of fact it would
be impossible to feed them during the march to
the Alamance where we counted on meeting our
companions-in-arms, to say nothing of providing
them with horses, for not more than half the
number were mounted, therefore Master Howell
called for a consultation in which all hands
were to take part.</p>

<p>It was not necessary to spend very much
breath over the question as to whether we would
try to hold them captives. They must be disposed
of in some manner, and without loss of
time; but yet our duty was to make certain
they did not join Tryon.</p>

<p>After hearing such propositions as our people
had to make, and some of them were wild indeed,
Master Howell raised the question as to
whether it would not be wise to release them on
parole?</p>

<p>This was the solution to the whole matter,
and if he had so stated it at first, we would have
decided within a few seconds.</p>

<p>On being consulted, our prisoners declared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
that they would readily take an oath not to
bear arms against us until after having been
properly exchanged, and all seemed pleased at
being able to get out of the scrape so easily.</p>

<p>The men were formed in a hollow square, and
each was required to repeat the oath Master
Howell administered, after which we parted
company, the paroled force going toward Charlotte,
and we riding at full speed toward the
Alamance, for it was to be expected that Tryon
would go there to seek us.</p>

<p>I would it were possible for me to set down
all the details of our movements; but the yarn
has already been spun out to such a length that
much which might, possibly, be interesting to
strangers must be omitted.</p>

<p>It suffices to say that within three days after
this encounter with General Waddel's force, we
of the two hundred which had been sent out to
gather in a supply of ammunition rejoined the
main body of Regulators, and much rejoicing
was there in camp after our story had been
told.</p>

<p>It was as if each of us had done something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
remarkable, to judge of the treatment we received,
and certain it was that those who had
been weak-kneed regarding our chances of a
successful opposition to Tryon, straightway became
convinced that we could force him to retreat
when the two forces came together.</p>

<p>During our absence it had been decided by
our leaders that we would await the enemy on
the banks of the Alamance, and there was no
good reason to change the plan after we returned.
We now had plenty of powder, and the women
from roundabout melted lead into bullets until
our wants were fully supplied.</p>

<p>We had already fought and captured a full
third of the force Governor Tryon counted on
bringing with him, and this was done by only
two hundred of our people, therefore it seemed
positive that when we met them, a thousand
Regulators against no more than fifteen hundred
militia and a few companies of soldiers, the result
would be in our favor.</p>

<p>Twenty men or more were sent out as scouts
and the remainder of our company lounged idly
in camp, when, as a matter of fact, every moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
should have been spent in fortifying the position.</p>

<p>More than one of our people suggested that it
would be a good plan to throw up breastworks,
but our leaders gave no heed to the suggestion,
and for the reason that they were suddenly
plunged into distress not unmixed with dismay.</p>

<p>Our old commander, the man upon whom all
relied at such a time, was taken with a most
serious illness, and it was believed that his days
on this earth were few.</p>

<p>It was necessary to carry the old gentleman
to a dwelling, and half a dozen of our best men
undertook this duty, leaving the command of
the force to Herman Husband, that member of
the force in which we placed implicit confidence.</p>

<p>As I look back upon that time, when all were
confident regarding the future, it seems indeed
strange that we should have selected as Master
Hamilton's successor the only member of our
company who would play us false.</p>

<p>It was as if the gallant Master Hamilton had
but just been carried away from us, when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
scouts came in with the news that Tryon was
approaching, having heard of General Waddel's
defeat.</p>

<p>Then it was we leaned upon Master Husband,
that man for whom we had risked our lives
three several times in order that he might be
spared imprisonment, and learned in the end
that he was no more than a broken reed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="s08">THE BATTLE.</span></h2>

<p>It was as if we had no sooner learned that
Tryon was near at hand than he came almost
upon us.</p>

<p>Just at sunset on the 13th day of May in the
year of grace 1771, our scouts came in with the
report that the governor's force was encamped
hardly more than six miles away, and was sending
out skirmishers to ascertain our position.</p>

<p>Master Husband's opinion was, and now he
had become the leader we learned that he could
be very obstinate once his mind was made up,
that our scouts should be drawn in lest, peradventure,
some of them be captured.</p>

<p>Thus it was we remained all in ignorance of
what the enemy might be doing until, at about
eight o'clock in the evening, our sentinels captured
two of the king's men who were out reconnoitering,
bringing them into camp.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<p>These were none other than Colonel John
Ashe and Captain John Walker.</p>

<p>Now has come the moment when I must
write of what we did to disgrace the Regulation,
because surely it was a disgrace for civilized
men claiming to be at war, to act as did the
Regulators through the advice, or, I might almost
say, the commands of, Master Husband.</p>

<p>As we learned afterward, our new leader
fancied he had cause for enmity against the two
gentlemen whom our sentinels had taken prisoners,
and within half an hour after they were
brought into camp, he ordered both tied to a
tree and severely whipped.</p>

<p>It was an outrage which cannot be excused,
however partial one may feel toward that organization
which first nourished the spirit of liberty
among the American people. Yet it was done,
and to Master Husband must be given the
blame.</p>

<p>In the Carolinas Colonel Ashe and Captain
Walker were looked upon as worthy gentlemen
even by those whose politics were of a different
complexion, and that we should flog them like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
slaves, nay, even in a more brutal fashion than
one would whip his own chattels, was dire disgrace.</p>

<p>Had Master Husband delayed even ten minutes
after making the proposal for punishment, our
people would have cried out against the outrage;
but it seemed almost as if the Regulators were
paralyzed by the mere suggestion of such an act
as had never before disgraced them, and a few of
the meaner spirits carried the order into execution
while the remainder of the company were
literally stupefied.</p>

<p>This was the first wrong done, so far as I knew,
by the Regulation, and nineteen out of every
twenty condemned it as brutal and uncalled-for.</p>

<p>When the punishment was concluded, however,
kindly hands took charge of the unfortunate
gentlemen, and if words could have soothed their
wounds, then of a verity had they been made
whole while yet the sting of the lash was upon
their flesh.</p>

<p>Master Husband knew full well that he was
censured by the majority of the company, and
it was as if from that moment he took the entire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
command into his hands, determined that we
should have no voice in whatsoever was done.</p>

<p>Thus it was that that brave company of gentlemen
followed blindly a leader who was very
shortly to prove himself a rank coward, raising no
mutiny as would have been done under other
circumstances, because we were facing the
enemy and bickerings might bring about a disaster.</p>

<p>When some of us would have accompanied
Colonel Ashe and Captain Walker to Tryon's
camp under a flag of truce, Master Husband
sternly forbade any such procedure, and declared
that he should hold the gentlemen prisoners
until after the enemy had retreated, or been
whipped in battle.</p>

<p>Next morning, instead of sending out skirmishers,
our leader appeared to think that a
written notice from him would be sufficient to
disperse the king's men, and accordingly he wrote
what it pleased him to call a "proclamation,"
setting forth the fact that the governor had come
contrary to law into counties over which he had
abandoned control, and demanded that he should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
send answer within four hours explaining when
it would please him to retreat.</p>

<p>We had among us the Reverend David Caldwell
of Orange, that good minister who followed
such of his congregation as belonged to the Regulation,
knowing full well a battle was imminent,
and believing he might acceptably serve
God and his fellow-man at the time when death
was about to seize upon some of us.</p>

<p>Master Caldwell had been among those who
spoke the loudest against Master Husband's brutality
of the previous evening; but now he accepted
the position of messenger in the hope that
he might prevail upon Tryon to draw off and
thus avert bloodshed.</p>

<p>The good man disdained to use a flag of truce;
but set off trusting that his cloth would protect
him, as indeed it did, for he was speedily given
audience with the enemy.</p>

<p>Governor Tryon received the clergyman graciously;
but excused himself from making a
reply to the ill-advised proclamation until noon
of the following day, because, as he said, until
then there would not be time to discuss the matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
with such of his officers as were entitled to
consideration.</p>

<p>However, he gave the parson the most positive
assurance that no blood should be shed unless
the Regulators began the battle; in other words,
he bound himself to keep his force in leash unless
we made an unprovoked assault.</p>

<p>When Master Caldwell came within our lines
again, he had a long interview with Master Husband,
the substance of which none of us knew
thoroughly; but it was whispered among the
more knowing, that the parson had insisted on
liberty being given to the two prisoners, and our
leader had flatly refused.</p>

<p>Master Howell and a dozen others who had
shared the command of the company with General
Hamilton, were loud in their complaints because
Master Husband refused to send out scouts, and,
finally, after no little bickerings which would
have swelled into open mutiny but for the situation
of affairs, they left the bigoted man to himself,
and sent secretly a dozen or more to spy
upon the enemy.</p>

<p>By this means we knew that during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
night Governor Tryon's force had crossed the
Alamance and marched silently along the Salisbury
road until within half a mile of our camp,
where they were formed in battle order by daybreak.</p>

<p>All this we of the rank and file knew; but
our leader remained in ignorance, and had no
suspicion that Parson Caldwell paid a second
visit to the governor before breakfast was served
our men, receiving from him another promise
that blood would not be shed by his force without
provocation; but now, having gained the position
he desired, Tryon demanded as the price
of peace, that the Regulation should surrender
unconditionally.</p>

<p>This he charged Master Caldwell to repeat
to our leader, and when Master Husband heard it
he showed himself, for a short time, as one who
understood somewhat of warfare, for as soon as
might be thereafter he marched us down the
road until we were halted within three hundred
yards of the governor's army.</p>

<p>Now did it appear as if the battle was to be
fought by words rather than bullets, for Tryon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
sent forward under flag of truce a magistrate
from Orange County, who read a lot of high-sounding
words to the effect that we were
ordered by the chief ruler of the colony to disperse
within an hour.</p>

<p>Then was come the time when we should have
set spurs to our horses and dashed into the king's
lines, for of a verity could we have put them
in full flight within ten minutes; but Master
Husband, beginning to feel the influence of that
cowardly fit which so beset him shortly afterward,
ordered Robert Thompson, a gentleman well
known among us all as being of a most peaceful
and amiable disposition but prone at all times to
speak his mind, to go into the governor's lines
and learn what arrangements might be made for
the settlement of the difficulty.</p>

<p>This command was given secretly, else would
Master Thompson never have been allowed to go
forth on such an errand when we were prepared
and eager to measure strength with the
enemy.</p>

<p>However, he went, and we remained in the
saddle mystified, wondering why any parley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
should be held, until we saw our comrade halt
in front of the governor himself.</p>

<p>Now this which I am to about to relate was
afterward told me by a member of Tryon's force.
As a matter of course all that we of the Regulation
could see was the movements of the men.</p>

<p>When Master Thompson advanced to the
governor, he was told abruptly, and without even
the ordinary civility which is due from one gentleman
to another, to make his way to the rear as a
prisoner.</p>

<p>Indignant because of such perfidy, he told the
brute Tryon some very plain truths regarding
his actions in the Carolinas, and wheeled about
to return to our lines.</p>

<p>My eyes were upon him at the moment, and
Sidney had expressed his satisfaction at seeing
Master Thompson coming toward us in such a
resolute manner, when I saw Tryon seize a musket
from the hands of a militiaman, and shoot the
Regulator dead.</p>

<p>At the same instant it was as if the governor
realized what he had done, for the smoke of the
musket had hardly more than cleared away before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
we saw a flag of truce advance; but the
murder of Robert Thompson was sufficient to
arouse us all, and an hundred rifles were immediately
emptied upon the bearer of the
flag.</p>

<p>Then it was that we would have advanced
without waiting for orders from Master Husband,
but that Parson Caldwell rode swiftly up
and down the line between us and the enemy, imploring
the Regulators to disperse rather than
bring civil war upon the colony.</p>

<p>We could not fire upon a man like Master
Caldwell, neither was it in our hearts to ride
him down, as we must have done had a charge
been made at that moment; but Tryon, losing
his senses through rage, as it seemed to me, gave
the word for the militia to fire.</p>

<p>Not a man obeyed the order.</p>

<p>Parson Caldwell continued to urge that we
have forbearance, and again Tryon called out for
his men to shoot, this time addressing the artillery
as well as militia.</p>

<p>It was as if both sides were listening to the
entreaties of the clergyman, when the bully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
Tryon, maddened with rage, rose in his stirrups
as he shouted frantically:</p>

<p>"Fire! Fire on them or on me!"</p>

<p>This order was given to the entire force, and
the men obeyed.</p>

<p>How many of our people fell I know not. On
the instant there came before my eyes a red mist;
my brain swam, and I only know that there was
but one desire in my heart, which was to kill&mdash;to
kill the brute who had neither the instincts of a
man nor the courage of a woman!</p>

<p>We Regulators fired rapidly as we could load
and discharge our pieces, and then suddenly
Sidney shouted:</p>

<p>"Come forward, lads! Spur your horses
hard and we may take those cannon, for the
men who work them act faint-hearted! Follow
me!"</p>

<p>An hundred or more of us responded to this call.
Riding forward at full speed we literally swept
the cannoneers from their pieces, and this done,
after many lives had paid the price, we saw that
man to whom General Hamilton had entrusted
the command of the gallant Regulators, ride like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
a coward down the road a short distance, and
then into the thicket.</p>

<p>Verily I believe there was not one among us
save he who would have shown the white
feather even in order to save his own life, and
we cursed him&mdash;while we battled against the
enemy we cursed him!</p>

<p>What followed I know not of my own knowledge.
It was as if a fever had seized upon me,
and when reason returned Sidney and I were in
the jail at Hillsborough, where we remained many
a long, dreary month before finally being allowed
to return to our homes under parole.</p>

<p>Here is an account as I have seen it set down
by another who wrote at a later day, when all
the facts were known, and in his words shall
be told the remainder of the distressing story
which began so bravely, and ended in shame and
in death.
<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>

"Some young men among the Regulators
rushed forward and took possession of the cannons.
They did not know how to manage them,
and soon abandoned them. The military now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
fired with vigor, and the Regulators fell back to
a ledge of rocks on the verge of a ravine, not,
however, until their ammunition was exhausted.</p>

<p>"Nine of the Regulators and twenty-seven
of the militia fell in that conflict, and a great
number on both sides were wounded. Tryon, in
his report, said, 'The loss of our army in killed,
wounded, and missing amounted to about sixty
men.'</p>

<p>"The admitted excesses of the Regulators
afford no excuse for the cruelty of Tryon after
the battle on the Alamance. With the implacable
spirit of revenge, he spent his wrath upon
his prisoners, and some of his acts were worthy
only of a barbarian. He exacted an oath of
allegiance from the people; levied contributions
of provisions; chastised those who dared to
offend him; and at Hillsborough he offered a
large reward for the bodies of Husband and other
Regulators, 'dead or alive.'</p>

<p>"At Hillsborough he held a court-martial for
the trial of his prisoners. Twelve were condemned
to suffer death; six were reprieved, and
the others were hung. His thirst for revenge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
satiated, Tryon returned to his palace at Newbern,
where he remained but a short time, having
been called to the administration of affairs in the
province of New York.</p>

<p>"The movements of the Regulators and the
result of the battle on the Alamance form an
important episode in the history of our Revolution.
Their resistance arose from oppressions
more personal and real than those which aroused
the people of New England. It was not wholly
the abstract idea of freedom for which they contended;
their strife consisted of efforts to relieve
themselves of actual burdens. While the tea-duty
was but a 'pepper-corn tribute,' imposing no real
burden upon the industry of the people in New
England, extortion in every form, and not to be
evaded, was eating out the substance of the working
men in North Carolina. Implied despotism
armed the New Englanders; actual despotism
panoplied the Carolinians. Each were equally
patriotic, and deserve our reverent gratitude.
The defeat on the Alamance did not break the
spirit of the patriots; and many, determined
no longer to suffer the oppressions of extortioners,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
abandoned their homes, with their wives
and children, went beyond the mountains, and
began settlements in the fertile valleys of the
Tennessee."</p>
